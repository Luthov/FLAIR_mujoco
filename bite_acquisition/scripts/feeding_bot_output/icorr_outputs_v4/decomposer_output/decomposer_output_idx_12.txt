Alternate between rice, chicken, and vegetables using small bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference indicates a desire to alternate between rice, chicken, and vegetables, specifically carrots in this context, while requesting that each bite is small.

Food Items Left: There are three food items left on the plate: rice, chicken, and carrots, each with two portions remaining.

Strategy: The high-level strategy involves following the user's preference to alternate between rice, chicken, and vegetables in that specific order, ensuring each bite is small. Since there is no bite history, we'll start with the first item in the sequence - rice.

Next food item: Since there is no previous food item mentioned and the preference is to start with rice following by chicken and then vegetables, and considering all items still have portions remaining, the first food item to start with is rice.
Next food item as string: 'rice'
Next bite size: The preference specifies the use of small bites. Although no specific value is given for "small," based on the adjustable parameters, a smaller value than the default of 5.0 is preferred. A value close to the smallest bite size that still allows the user to perceive it as a deliberate choice is ideal.

Keep the spoon at a distance.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to keep the spoon at a distance while taking a bite.

Strategy: Since the user's preference indicates a desire for the spoon to be further away, the distance_to_mouth parameter will be adjusted towards the higher end of the available range. The absence of any specific preference regarding the exit angle means this parameter will remain at the default value, as there is no indication to adjust it higher or lower.

Next distance to mouth: The user's preference for keeping the spoon at a distance is considered, leading to the selection of a value towards the upper end of the range, but still within a reasonable reach for comfortable eating.

Next distance to mouth as float: 9.0

Next exit angle: Given the lack of specific preference about the exit angle's adjustment, it is kept at the default value. This approach ensures general usability and comfort during the eating process without any indicated need for adjustment.

Summary: The user prefers to alternate between rice, chicken, and vegetables, opting for small bites.

Food Items Left: There are rice, chicken, and carrots left on the plate with 2 portions remaining for each.

Strategy: The strategy involves adhering to the user's preference of alternating between rice, chicken, and vegetables (carrots in this case) in that specific order, and choosing small bites for each food item. Given that the last food item fed was rice, the next in sequence based on the user’s preference would be chicken.

Next food item: Since the preference is to alternate between rice, chicken, and vegetables with the last food item being rice, and given that chicken still has portions remaining, the next logical choice is chicken to maintain the alternating sequence.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: The user has specified a preference for small bites. The last bite size recorded for rice was 1.0, which aligns with the preference for small bites. Therefore, to maintain consistency with the user's preference, a small bite size will be selected again.

Keep the spoon at a distance.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to keep the spoon at a distance when taking a bite.

Strategy: To decide on the parameters for the next spoonful of food, the user's explicit preference to keep the spoon at a distance will guide the choice for distance_to_mouth. Since the user hasn’t specified a preference for the exit_angle and there’s no clear instruction to change it based on the food type, we'll maintain the default value or consider the last exit angle used, as appropriate.

Next distance to mouth: The preference states "Keep the spoon at a distance," and the previous distance used was 9.0, which aligns with this preference. Since there is no indication that the user found the previous distance unsatisfactory and to consistently follow the user's preference for distance, the same distance will be maintained.
Next distance to mouth as float: 9.0

Next exit angle: Since there’s no specific preference stated for the exit_angle and the last used angle was 90.0, which is the default, and because no further instruction indicates a need to change it based on the type of food (chicken), the exit angle will remain unchanged to maintain a stable parameter for the user.
