=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers that all the chicken is fed first, followed by the rice, and desires smaller bites for the rice.

Food Items Left: There are chicken, rice, and peas left on the plate, each with two portions remaining.

Strategy: Since the user has a clear preference for the order in which the food items should be consumed, with a priority on finishing all portions of one food before moving to the next and a specific instruction for bite sizes for the rice, the strategy is to follow this preference order and adjust bite sizes accordingly.

Next food item: As per the user's preference, chicken should be fed first, and since it has portions remaining and has been prioritized over other foods, it will be the next food item to feed.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
Next bite size: There is no specific preference stated for the bite size of the chicken, so we default to the middle value of 5.0.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Be careful not to tilt the spoon too much.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference indicates a caution against tilting the spoon too much, implying that a more conservative (lower) exit angle should be used to avoid potential spills.

Strategy: Given the preference to not tilt the spoon too much, we will aim for a lower end of the exit angle range while keeping the distance to the mouth at the default value, as there is no specific preference indicating it should be closer or further.

Next distance to mouth: Since there is no preference indicating a change in the distance to the mouth, we will keep it at the default value of 7.5 to ensure comfort and avoid unnecessary adjustments. 

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Considering the user's preference to be careful not to tilt the spoon too much, we'll opt for a slightly lower exit angle than the default of 90.0 degrees. This aims to minimize the risk of spilling while ensuring the food can be comfortably transferred to the mouth. A value slightly lower than the default should provide a balance between safety and efficacy.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed all the chicken first, followed by the rice, and requests smaller bites for their meals.

Food Items Left: The plate currently has chicken, rice, and peas, with 2 portions remaining for each.

Strategy: Given the user’s preference and remaining portions, the high-level strategy is to continue feeding the chicken until it is finished, then move on to the rice, while adjusting the bite size to be smaller than the default.

Next food item: Since the user's preference is to have all the chicken first and there are still portions of chicken remaining, the next food item should be 'chicken'. The bite history shows that chicken has been eaten before, confirming that we are following the user's preferred order correctly.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: The user's preference indicates a desire for smaller bites. Given that the last bite size was 5.0, which is the default, and no specific smaller size was recommended previously, we will choose a smaller value while staying above the minimum to respect the user’s preference.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Be careful not to tilt the spoon too much.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers not to tilt the spoon too much when taking a bite.

Strategy: Since the preference is specifically about not tilting the spoon too much, this directly impacts the exit_angle parameter. The preference does not mention anything about the distance to mouth, so we will keep this parameter at its previous value. Given the last exit angle used was 85.0 which implies a careful approach to tilting, we can assume this was satisfactory and stick to a similar value to respect the user's preference.

Next distance to mouth: There's no specific preference indicating a need to change the distance, so we will use the previous bite's distance_to_mouth value.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: The preference to not tilt the spoon too much suggests using a lower tilt angle within the specified range. Since the previous exit angle at 85.0 likely satisfied this preference, it seems reasonable to maintain this value.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have all the chicken fed to them first, followed by the rice, and prefers smaller bites compared to larger ones.

Food Items Left: On the plate, there are chicken (1 portion left), rice (2 portions left), and peas (2 portions left).

Strategy: Given the user's preference for food order and bite size, the strategy will prioritize finishing the remaining portion of chicken before moving on to rice, and opt for a smaller bite size based on both the user's preference and previous bite sizes.

Next food item: Since there is still one portion of chicken left and the user specified to feed all the chicken first, the next food item should be chicken, honoring the user's stated preference order.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
Next bite size: The user prefers smaller bites and the bite history shows a reduction from 5.0 to 4.0. Continuing with this preference, a size slightly smaller than the last size should be chosen, acknowledging the user's preference for smaller bites without a specific value given.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have all the chicken fed first, followed by the rice, and prefers the rice to be served in smaller bites.

Food Items Left: There are chicken, rice, and peas left on the plate. The portions remaining for these items are 1, 2, and 2 respectively.

Strategy: According to the user's preference and the portions left for each item, the strategy is to continue serving chicken until it is finished, and then move on to serve rice with smaller bite sizes. Peas will not be considered until both chicken and rice have been fully served.

Next food item: Since there is still a portion of chicken left and the preference states to feed all the chicken first, chicken will be the next food item to be served. 

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: The user preference mentions using smaller bites for rice but does not specify a change in bite size for chicken. Given the last bite size for chicken was 3.5 and aiming for consistency without any explicit instruction to further reduce the size, the same size will be applied.

Next bite size as float: 3.5
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Be careful not to tilt the spoon too much.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers not to tilt the spoon too much, emphasizing a more cautious approach to the exit angle to prevent spillage.

Strategy: Given the preference for not tilting the spoon too much and the consistent use of 85.0 for exit_angle in the bite history, the approach will involve adjusting the parameters to closely align with these precedents while adhering to the explicit caution against excessive tilting.

Next distance to mouth: There is no explicit preference indicating a change in the distance_to_mouth from the default or historical distance of 7.5. Therefore, this parameter remains unchanged to maintain a comfortable reach based on previous successful attempts.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Considering the preference to "be careful not to tilt the spoon too much," and knowing that the past successful bites used an exit_angle of 85.0, which is lower than the default of 90.0, it's prudent to stick to this tried-and-true angle. It aligns with the caution against excessive tilting, potentially reducing the risk of spillage from the spoon.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user wants to be fed all the chicken first, then move on to the rice, with a preference for smaller bites.

Food Items Left: There are no chicken portions left, 2 portions of rice, and 2 portions of peas available.

Strategy: Prioritize the user's preference by feeding them the food items in their specified order, with an emphasis on smaller bite sizes. Given that all the chicken has been fed, the next item according to the user's preference should be rice.

Next food item: Since all the chicken has been consumed and the user’s preference is to feed rice next, and considering rice still has portions remaining, the next food item should be rice.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The user has expressed a preference for smaller bites. Previous bite sizes have been reducing over time, with the last bite being 3.5. To continue in line with the user's preference, a size slightly smaller than the last, or equal to the last if aiming for consistency, should be chosen. Since 3.5 is already considered a smaller bite, it's sensible to maintain that size to ensure the user's comfort.

Next bite size as float: 3.5
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Be careful not to tilt the spoon too much.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to avoid tilting the spoon too much to ensure the food stays on the spoon properly without spilling.

Strategy: Given the preference to not tilt the spoon too much and the history of using an exit angle of 85.0 degrees for chicken, it's reasonable to apply a similar approach for rice. Rice, being smaller and potentially less cohesive than chunks of chicken, might be more prone to spilling if the spoon is tilted too much. The distance_to_mouth has consistently been 7.5, which implies the user finds this distance comfortable and there's no preference indicating a need to adjust it for rice.

Next distance to mouth: Since there's no specific preference mentioned about adjusting the distance, and the historical distance has always been 7.5, it's logical to maintain this distance for consistency and comfort.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The preference to not tilt the spoon too much suggests that keeping the exit angle lower rather than higher would be desirable. Given that all previous bites with chicken were at an exit angle of 85.0 and considering the nature of rice, a similar or slightly lower angle might be best to prevent spillage without specific indications to adjust it differently.

Summary: The user prefers to have all the chicken served first, followed by the rice, and prefers smaller bite sizes over larger ones.

Food Items Left: There are no portions of chicken left, 2 portions of rice, and 2 portions of peas remaining on the plate.

Strategy: Following the user's preference to feed all of one food item before moving to the next, and given the preference for smaller bite sizes, the next food item should be rice, as all chicken has been served and rice is next in the user's order of preference.

Next food item: Since all chicken has been consumed and rice is next in line according to the user's preferences, with portions still remaining, the next food item should logically be 'rice'. 

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The user's preference for smaller bites coupled with the historical data showing a trend towards smaller bite sizes (last bite was 3.5) supports setting the bite size just below the last value, maintaining adherence to the preference for smaller bites.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Be careful not to tilt the spoon too much.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference indicates a caution against tilting the spoon too much, suggesting that they prefer a lower exit angle to avoid spills or dropping food.

Strategy: Given the caution against too much tilt, we look at the historical preference for exit angles, noting it has consistently been 85.0 degrees for both chicken and rice. This value suggests a successful balance between avoiding spills and ensuring the food is transferred efficiently. The distance to mouth has consistently been 7.5, which has worked well for the user, as there is no specific preference indicating a change from this default value.

Next distance to mouth: There is no indication from the user's preference on needing to adjust the distance to the mouth from what has been previously successful. Therefore, the default of 7.5, which aligns with all previous bite parameters, is chosen.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Since the user's preference advises caution against tilting the spoon too much, and given that past bites have all used an exit angle of 85.0 successfully (showing a consistency in their preference for a slight tilt), this value is selected to continue meeting the user's preference for minimizing tilt.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Be careful not to tilt the spoon too much.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference indicates a concern about not tilting the spoon too much when delivering the food to their mouth. This suggests a preference for a lower exit angle to avoid spillage, especially considering the next bite is rice, which can easily spill if the spoon is tilted too much.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference for not tilting the spoon too much and the consistent exit angles used in the bite history for both chicken and rice, which were set at 85.0, it seems prudent to follow this pattern. It suggests that an 85.0 exit angle works well for the user, likely balancing the need to keep the food on the spoon without causing discomfort or spillage during the transfer to the mouth. There is no explicit preference mentioned for adjusting the distance to the mouth, so keeping it at the default or historical value is sensible.

Next distance to mouth: Since the bite history shows a consistent distance to mouth of 7.5 for both chicken and rice, and no specific preference was mentioned about adjusting this parameter, the best approach is to stick with this tried and tested distance. It seems to be an effective balance for the user when eating different types of food without any indication from the user to adjust it.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The preference against tilting the spoon too much, combined with the historical use of an 85.0 angle for different food types, suggests that this angle adequately meets the user's needs. It is likely considered a safe tilt that minimizes the risk of spillage while being comfortable for the user to eat from. Adhering to this preference and historical pattern supports a seamless eating experience.

Summary: The user prefers to have all the chicken fed to them first, and then move on to the rice, preferring smaller bites for both.

Food Items Left: There are portions remaining for 'rice' (1 portion) and 'peas' (2 portions). There's no chicken left.

Strategy: Since the preference is to feed chicken first and then rice with smaller bites, and all the chicken has been fed, the next logical choice is rice, following the preference order. This prioritizes the user's preference while ensuring we choose an item with portions remaining.

Next food item: Since all the chicken has been fed and rice is the next preferred item with a portion remaining, rice is the logical choice. 'Peas' are also available, but the user preference dictates feeding rice next.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The preference stated is for smaller bites for rice, following the history of decreasing bite sizes for rice recently from 3.5 to 2.5, suggesting a continuation of this trend might be preferred. The latest bite size for rice was 2.5, so choosing a slightly smaller bite seems in line with the user's preference for smaller bites for rice.

Next bite size as float: 2.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Be careful not to tilt the spoon too much.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference highlights a caution against tilting the spoon too much, which implies a preference for a more conservative exit angle to avoid spillage.

Strategy: Given the preference to be careful not to tilt the spoon too much, the exit angle should be adjusted in a manner that minimizes the risk of spillage. Since rice is the next bite, and looking at the bite history where the exit angle has consistently been 85.0 for both chicken and rice, this suggests that the angle has been effective for previous bites. To adhere to the user's caution regarding the tilt, it will be prudent to maintain or slightly adjust this angle to ensure safety and comfort during feeding without making significant deviations that could lead to spillage.

Next distance to mouth: Since the preference does not specifically mention adjusting the distance to the mouth and the distance has consistently been 7.5 in the bite history for both chicken and rice, maintaining this distance would adhere to the user's unstated but implied comfort level with the current setup. There's no indication that changing the distance would benefit the user's experience or address the user's concern about the tilt.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Considering the user's preference to be cautious about tilting the spoon too much, coupled with the consistent use of an 85.0 exit angle in the bite history, it makes sense to continue with this exit angle. This angle presumably has worked well in preventing spillage while being comfortable for the user. Slight adjustments might be considered if there was a specific issue mentioned, but staying close to the previously successful angle aligns with the user's caution.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to eat all of the chicken first, then all of the rice, and prefers smaller bites over larger ones.

Food Items Left: There are only peas left on the plate with 2 portions remaining.

Strategy: Given the user's preference to eat chicken first, then rice, and the fact that both of these items have been fully consumed (based on portions remaining), the next logical choice following the preference and the items left would be to proceed with peas. The user's preference for smaller bites will also be taken into account for the bite size parameter.

Next food item: Since chicken and rice are both fully consumed, and peas are the only food item left with portions remaining, peas will be the next food item to feed, aligning with the user's expressed preference sequence as much as possible given the remaining options.

Next food item as string: 'peas'

Next bite size: Considering the user's preference for smaller bites and analyzing the decreasing trend of bite sizes in the bite history for both chicken and rice, it is clear the user prefers smaller bites over time. The last few bites for rice were in the decreasing order from 3.5 to 2.0. Following this trend and user preference, further decreasing the bite size is advised.
