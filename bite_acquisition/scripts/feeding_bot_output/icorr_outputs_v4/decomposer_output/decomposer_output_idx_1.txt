Alternate bites of chicken and rice; larger bite sizes preferred.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and rice with larger bite sizes, indicating a clear sequence in the food items they want to be fed and a preference for the size of each bite.

Food Items Left: There are portions left of chicken, rice, and peas, each with 2 portions remaining.

Strategy: Given the preference for alternating bites of chicken and rice and larger bite sizes, the strategy involves following this sequence while ignoring peas unless specifically requested or necessary to alternation. Since there's no previous bite in the history, we'll start with the user's first preference: chicken.

Next food item: Since there are no previous bites to consider for sequence, and the user prefers alternating bites of chicken and rice with a starting point that is not mentioned but inferred to be the first preferred item, the next food item should be 'chicken' considering it is available and aligns with the start of the preferred sequence.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: The user's preference indicates larger bite sizes are preferred without specifying an exact size; thus, selecting a value higher than the default 5.0, while not choosing the maximum to allow room for increasing size if desired in subsequent bites. Given this, a bite size larger than average but not at the maximum seems appropriate.

Next bite size as float: 7.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Spoon to be further away during feeding.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be further away during feeding.

Strategy: Since the user prefers the spoon to be further away, the distance_to_mouth should be adjusted towards the higher end of the range. There is no preference stated for the exit_angle, so it will remain at the default.

Next distance to mouth: The user's preference for a "further" distance dictates increasing the standard distance. Given the range is from 5.0 to 10.0, and the default is 7.5, selecting a value above 7.5, yet not at the maximum to allow for future adjustments if necessary, would adhere to the user's preference. Opting for a comfortably more distant but reasonable value, I choose 8.5.

Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5

Next exit angle: Since there's no specified preference for the exit_angle, it will stay at the default value to ensure a neutral spoon tilt. The default is designed for an average scenario which should suit the lack of user preference in this case.

Next exit angle as float: 90.0

Alternate bites of chicken and rice with larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to alternate bites of chicken and rice, opting for larger bite sizes than the default.

Food Items Left: There are three food items left on the plate: chicken, rice, and peas, each with 2 portions remaining.

Strategy: The strategy involves alternating between chicken and rice based on the user's preference for variety and larger bites, while considering the previous bite to maintain the alternating sequence. Peas will be considered only if both prioritized items are finished or in the absence of a clear preference after chicken and rice.

Next food item: Since the last bite was chicken, and the user prefers to alternate between chicken and rice with a preference for larger bites, the next logical choice would be rice. This respects the user's order preference and also ensures a variation in the meal.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The user prefers larger bites than the default. The last recorded bite size was 7.0, which is larger than the default. To maintain consistency with the user's preference for larger bites, we will match the last bite size.

Next bite size as float: 7.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Spoon to be further away during feeding.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be further away during feeding.

Strategy: This preference directly influences the choice of distance_to_mouth. Since the last bite of chicken used an 8.5 setting, which is further than the default but not at the maximum, and because the user prefers the spoon to be further away from the mouth, we will maintain a similar distance to meet the user's comfort. The exit angle parameter, which determines the tilt of the spoon, has no specific preference indicated, so we will retain the default setting used previously, considering no request for adjustment was provided.

Next distance to mouth: The preference for the spoon to be further away is met by selecting a distance similar to the previous setting, which also aligns with the user's comfort based on the past bite's success.

Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5

Next exit angle: No specific preference for tilt was indicated or needed based on the userâ€™s preferences, so the default exit angle from the prior setting is used to ensure consistency in delivery.

Alternate bites of chicken and rice are preferred, with a preference for larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to alternate bites of chicken and rice, with a preference for larger bites. There are no explicit preferences for peas, but they are included in the items remaining.

Food Items Left: There are portions left for each of the three items on the plate: 'chicken', 'rice', and 'peas', with each having 2 portions remaining.

Strategy: Based on the preference for alternating between chicken and rice and considering the last food item fed was 'rice', the next item should be 'chicken' to maintain the alternating pattern. The preference for larger bites will also be considered in determining the bite size.

Next food item: Given the alternating preference between chicken and rice, and since the most recent bite was rice, the next food item should be 'chicken', as it aligns with the user's preferences and there are portions remaining.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: The preference is for larger bites, and given the history of bite sizes being 7.0 for both chicken and rice, it is consistent to continue with this larger bite size to align with the user's preference.

Next bite size as float: 7.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
The spoon should be further away during feeding.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be further away during feeding.

Strategy: Since the preference is for the spoon to be further away, and the previous distances used were 8.5, which is already further than the default of 7.5, it seems appropriate to either maintain this distance or adjust slightly further within the specified range to ensure comfort and preference are met. For the exit angle, given no specific preference was provided, and previous bites used a 90.0 degree exit angle, maintaining this default seems most appropriate to ensure consistency with the user's successful bites.

Next distance to mouth: Considering the user's preference for the spoon to be further away and the success of previous bites at 8.5, I will keep to this preference. However, to slightly enhance the adherence to their preference for it to be "further away," I will adjust the distance slightly more, but ensure it's within a comfortable and practical range, choosing a value somewhat higher than 8.5 but still below the maximum of 10.0.

Next distance to mouth as float: 9.0

Next exit angle: Since there has been no expressed preference for changing the exit angle and previous entries have successfully used 90.0, there's no compelling reason to adjust this parameter. Keeping it at this value should ensure consistency with the user's previous successful eating experiences.

Alternate bites of chicken and rice, larger bite sizes.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference clearly indicates a liking for alternating bites between chicken and rice with a penchant for larger bite sizes, specifically larger than the default size.

Food Items Left: On the plate, there are chicken, rice, and peas left with corresponding portions of 1, 2, and 2, respectively.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for alternating between chicken and rice with larger bite sizes, and considering the most recent bite was chicken, the next logical food item following the preference would be rice. This aligns with the alternate ordering and the available portions. Peas have not been mentioned in the preference and will not be prioritized.

Next food item: Since the last recorded bite was of 'chicken' and the preference is for alternating bites of chicken and rice with an emphasis on larger sizes, and considering both have portions remaining, the next food item should be 'rice' to adhere to the preference and the sequence of food items being alternated.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The preference specified larger bite sizes, and the bite history shows a consistent choice of 7.0, which is larger than the default. Keeping in line with this preference, the bite size should again be larger than the default value.

Next bite size as float: 7.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Spoon to be further away during feeding.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be further away during feeding.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for the spoon to be further away, I will adjust the distance_to_mouth parameter to reflect this preference, leaning on the higher end of prior values for guidance. Since there is no specific preference indicated for the exit_angle, I will maintain it at the default of 90.0 degrees, as there has been no feedback suggesting a need for adjustment in this area.

Next distance to mouth: The preference is for the spoon to be further away, and the previous distances have been increasing slightly with each feeding, from 8.5 to 9.0. Given this pattern, I will choose a distance slightly further than the last, ensuring the spoon is further away while still being comfortable for the user.

Next distance to mouth as float: 9.5

Next exit angle: There is no expressed preference regarding the exit_angle, and the past bites have consistently used an angle of 90.0 degrees without any indicated need for change. Therefore, I will keep the exit_angle at the default of 90.0 degrees.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
The user wants alternate bites of chicken and rice and prefers larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to alternate between bites of chicken and rice, with a preference for larger bites.

Food Items Left: There are portions of chicken, rice, and peas left on the plate, with quantities for each being 1, 1, and 2, respectively.

Strategy: The strategy involves adhering to the user's preference for alternating between chicken and rice and choosing larger bites. Given the bite history, the sequence should continue by selecting the food item that comes next in the alternation, provided it still has portions remaining. Peas will be considered only if they fit into the preferences explicitly stated or if no other preferred items are available and complying with the user's preference for larger bites.

Next food item: Since the most recent food item consumed was rice and the user prefers to alternate between chicken and rice, and considering both chicken and rice still have portions remaining, the next logical choice, adhering to the user's preferences, is chicken. Peas have not been mentioned in the preference and will not be chosen over the preferred items.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: The user has a preference for larger bites, and the bite history shows a consistent choice of 7.0 for both chicken and rice. To honor the user's preference for larger bites, it is logical to continue with this size, as it aligns with their established preference.

Next bite size as float: 7.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
The user prefers for the spoon to be further away during feeding.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be further away during feeding, indicating a distance to mouth value on the higher end within the possible range.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference for the spoon to be further away, and observing the increasing distance values in the bite history, the parameters for the next bite should continue this trend slightly. Since the last value was 9.5 and the user's preference indicates further away, we should select a value that is closer to the maximum allowable distance but not at the extreme to allow for adjustments based on future feedback. The exit angle has consistently been 90.0 with no indicated preference for changing it, so it will remain the same as default.

Next distance to mouth: Given the userâ€™s preference for further distance and the progression in the bite history, increasing the distance to mouth slightly beyond the last value will align with both the userâ€™s preference and observed trend. However, to ensure comfortable feeding while respecting the user's preference for the spoon to be further, a modest increase from the most recent distance is advised.

Next distance to mouth as float: 9.7

Next exit angle: Without specific cues for a preferred change in the exit angle and considering the stability of this parameter across different bites, maintaining the default exit angle of 90.0 supports both consistency and lack of indication for change.

The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and rice and larger bite sizes.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and rice with larger bite sizes, indicating a preference for a specific order and size of bite.

Food Items Left: On the plate, there are items remaining including chicken, rice, and peas, with corresponding portions of 1 (chicken), 1 (rice), and 2 (peas).

Strategy: The strategy will be to follow the user's preference for alternating bites of chicken and rice while considering the portions left. Given the bite history and preference for larger bite sizes, the next choice should maintain the alternation pattern and respect the user's preference for bite size.

Next food item: Given the bite history shows alternating bites of chicken and rice, with the most recent being chicken, the next food item should be rice to maintain the preferred pattern. Rice also has portions remaining, making it a valid choice.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The user prefers larger bite sizes, as indicated by the history of bite sizes being 7.0, which is larger than the default. Therefore, we will continue with this preference.

The user prefers the spoon to be further away during feeding.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be further away from them during feeding, as indicated by the increase in the distance_to_mouth parameter over the course of prior feedings.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for the spoon to be further away and the observed trend in previous bite parameters where the distance_to_mouth gradually increased, I will continue this pattern by selecting a distance slightly greater than the most recent feeding to accommodate their preference. For the exit angle, there is no indicated preference for altering this parameter, and the historical data shows a consistent value of 90.0. Therefore, I will maintain this default value.

Next distance to mouth: In accordance with the user's preference for "further" and observing the trend in the bite history where the distance was last set at 9.7, I will increase this slightly to continue accommodating their preference and to reflect the incremental adjustments seen previously.

Next distance to mouth as float: 9.9

Next exit angle: Since there's no specific preference for altering the exit angle and the historical data consistently shows an angle of 90.0 with no adjustments made despite the different bite types (chicken, rice), I will keep this parameter unchanged.

Alternate bites of chicken and rice, preferring larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and rice, with a preference for larger bites. 

Food Items Left: There are portions left for each of the food items on the plate: 1 portion of chicken, 1 portion of rice, and 2 portions of peas.

Strategy: The strategy focuses on adhering to the user's preference for alternating bites of chicken and rice with larger bites and then considering what is left on the plate. Since peas were not mentioned in the preference, and there is a clear pattern of alternating between chicken and rice in the bite history, the next food item will follow this pattern.

Next food item: The last food item fed was rice, following the user's pattern of preferring chicken and rice alternately. The next logical food item based on the preference and the previous pattern is chicken, and there is still a portion of chicken remaining.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: The preference indicates a liking for larger bites, and the history has consistently shown a preference for 7.0 bite sizes, which is larger than the default 5.0. Therefore, following the user's preference for larger bites, the next bite size should also be larger, maintaining the pattern established in the bite history.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be further away during feeding, showing a consistent increase in the distance for both chicken and rice bites.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference for the spoon to be further away and the incremental increase observed in the bite history, the next value should continue this trend. There is no mentioned preference for changing the exit angle, so it will remain at the default value.

Next distance to mouth: The bite history shows a gradual increase in distance, concluding with 9.9 for rice. Considering the preference for the spoon to be further and the trend, the next logical increment within the given bounds would be to select a distance marginally greater than 9.9, adhering to the upper limit.

Next distance to mouth as float: 10.0

Alternate bites of chicken and rice with larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and rice, with a preference for larger bites.

Food Items Left: There are items left on the plate: 'chicken' with no portions remaining, 'rice' with 1 portion remaining, and 'peas' with 2 portions remaining.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference for alternating bites of chicken and rice with larger bites, and taking into account the portions remaining, my strategy will involve selecting the next available food item that aligns with this alternating pattern, while also considering the available portions.

Next food item: Since the last food item consumed was chicken, and the preference is to alternate between chicken and rice, the next logical choice would be rice. Given that there is 1 portion of rice remaining, it fits the criteria of being available. However, since 'chicken' portions are exhausted and peas were not part of the specified preference, the pattern can't be continued as stated; nonetheless, 'rice' remains the choice aligning most closely with the user's preferences and available portions.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The userâ€™s preference specifies larger bites and the bite history consistently shows a bite size of 7.0 for both chicken and rice, suggesting that the larger bite size preference has been interpreted as 7.0. Thus, maintaining this size for the next bite aligns with the userâ€™s preferences as demonstrated by the bite history.

Next bite size as float: 7.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Prefer the spoon to be further away during feeding.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be further away during feeding.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for the spoon to be further away, we look at the progression in the bite history for rice and notice a steady increase in the distance_to_mouth parameter with each feeding event involving rice. The distance has been incrementally adjusted upwards for both chicken and rice, with the last rice feeding at 9.9. Since chicken's last distance was set at 10.0 (the maximum allowed), and considering the user's clear preference for increasing distance, we will maintain this trajectory.

Next distance to mouth: Despite rice's last distance being 9.9, and since we've reached the maximum for chicken at 10.0, we will match that setting for rice to cater to the user's preference for the spoon to be further away, indicating the user's comfort at this maximum distance.

Next distance to mouth as float: 10.0

Next exit angle: There are no explicit preferences indicated for the exit angle, and the historical data for both chicken and rice consistently show it set at 90.0. With no discernible reason to adjust this parameter based on user preference or history, we will maintain the default setting.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and rice and desires larger bites.

Food Items Left: On the plate, there are no portions of chicken and rice left, but 2 portions of peas remain.

Strategy: The strategy involves adhering to the userâ€™s preference for alternating bites between chicken and rice and selecting larger bites. However, given that both chicken and rice have been fully consumed and only peas remain, the priority shifts to feeding the remaining food item while considering the user's preference for bite size.

Next food item: Since chicken and rice have no portions left and peas are the only remaining food item with available portions, peas become the sensible choice despite not aligning with the user's stated preference for alternating between chicken and rice.

Next food item as string: 'peas'

Next bite size: The user prefers larger bites, and the bite history shows previous bites were of size 7.0, larger than the default 5.0. Although peas were not part of the user's stated preference for food items, the bite size preference should still be honored.

The spoon should be further away from the user during feeding.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be positioned further away from them during feeding. 

Strategy: To adhere to the user's preference for the spoon to be further away, I will analyze the progression in the distance_to_mouth from the bite history. There has been a clear trend towards maximizing the distance, culminating in the most recent distance being at the maximum value of 10.0. Since there is no expressed preference regarding the exit angle and given the consistent maintenance of the exit angle at 90.0 in the bite history, it is prudent to keep it unchanged.

Next distance to mouth: The preference has been clearly towards increasing the distance to mouth, with the latest entries in the bite history reaching the maximum possible value of 10.0, which complies with the preference for the spoon to be further away.

Next distance to mouth as float: 10.0

Next exit angle: There has been no expressed preference to adjust the exit angle, and the bite history shows a consistent exit angle of 90.0 for all types of food consumed. Therefore, maintaining this exit angle is the best course of action.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternate bites of chicken and rice, with a side note of preferring larger bites overall.

Food Items Left: There are portions of peas remaining on the plate, with chicken and rice having been fully consumed.

Strategy: Since the preference is to alternate between chicken and rice, and since both of these are no longer available, the strategy shifts to feeding what is available while still adhering to the preference of larger bite sizes.

Next food item: Given that peas are the only food item left with portions remaining and considering there's no specific order of preference involving peas, it's the sensible choice. The previous bite of peas also suggests it's within the user's current meal plan.

Next food item as string: 'peas'

Next bite size: The user has a preference for larger bites, as evidenced by the history of bite sizes (7.0 for chicken, rice, and peas). There's no indication the user wishes to change from this preference; thus, we'll maintain the previously established bite size of 7.0.

Spoon to be further away during feeding.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be further away during feeding. This preference is clearly shown in the progression of previous bites, gradually increasing from closer distances to the maximum allowed distance.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for the spoon to be further away and the consistent increase in distance to mouth in their bite history, especially with the last few bites all being at the maximum distance, the parameters for the next bite will continue to respect this preference. As for the exit angle, there's no explicit preference indicated by the user nor a variation in previous bites; thus, it will remain at the default.

Next distance to mouth: Based on the user's preference for the spoon to be further away and the observation that the last three bites were all taken at the maximum distance of 10.0, it is logical to maintain this distance to ensure comfort and satisfaction.

Next distance to mouth as float: 10.0

Next exit angle: Since there is no indication from the user's preference or bite history that requires changing the exit angle from the default setting of 90.0, it stays unchanged to provide a neutral and consistent feeding experience that has so far presumably been satisfactory.
