=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user’s preference is to feed all the rice first, then alternate between chicken and vegetables.
Food Items Left: The plate currently has rice, chicken, and carrots, each with portions remaining of 2.
Strategy: I will follow the user's preference by feeding all the rice first. Since rice is still available, it should be prioritized over chicken and vegetables regardless of any previously fed items.
Next food item: Since rice is still available and matches the user's preference to be fed first, rice will be selected as the next food item to feed.
Next food item as string: 'rice'
Next bite size: No specific preference was stated for bite size; thus, the default value of 5.0 is used.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has not expressed any specific preference for the adjustment of bite transfer parameters for the next spoonful of food.
Strategy: Since there are no explicit preferences provided by the user or discernible from the bite history (which is currently empty), the default values will be used for both parameters. This is in adherence to the instructions to default to specified values when no preference is indicated.
Next distance to mouth: The user has not specified a preference for the distance_to_mouth, and there is no bite history to infer any preference, so the default value will be used.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: The user has not indicated a preference for the exit_angle, and no previous bites have been logged to suggest an implicit preference, so the default value will be used.
Next exit angle as float: 90.0

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to eat all the rice first, followed by an alternation between chicken and vegetables.
Food Items Left: There are portions of rice, chicken, and carrots left on the plate, each with two portions remaining.
Strategy: Finish feeding all of the rice first as per the user's preference, before alternating between chicken and vegetables.
Next food item: Since there is still rice left and the user's preference is to finish the rice first, the next food item should be rice to comply with the user's specific ordering preference.
Next food item as string: 'rice'
Next bite size: There is no specific user preference mentioned for adjusting the bite size from the standard 5.0, so it will remain unchanged.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has no expressed preference for distance to mouth or exit angle adjustments based on their history or current input.
Strategy: Since there is no specified preference or feedback that indicates the user was dissatisfied with the previous parameters, it is appropriate to replicate the previous bite parameters. This approach is in adherence to maintaining consistency in the absence of expressed preferences or indications for adjustments.
Next distance to mouth: There is no indication of preference for adjusting the distance to mouth from the previous setting, so it will remain the same.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Summary: The user's preference is to finish all rice first, then alternate between chicken and vegetables.
Food Items Left: There are rice, chicken, and carrots left on the plate with corresponding portions of 1, 2, 2 each.
Strategy: Given the user's preference and the bite history, the strategy is to continue feeding rice until it's finished, then alternate between chicken and vegetables, with the previous food item considered for alternating.
Next food item: Since rice still has a portion remaining and the preference is to feed all the rice first, the next item should be rice.
Next food item as string: 'rice'
Next bite size: No specific preference has been stated, so defaulting to the previous bite size, which is 5.0.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has not expressed any specific preferences for distance to mouth or exit angle for their spoonfuls of rice.
Strategy: Given the lack of expressed preferences, I will rely on the bite history to guide the adjustments. The user has consistently used 7.5 for distance_to_mouth and 90.0 for exit_angle in their previous bites, indicating satisfaction or at least no issues with these settings.
Next distance to mouth: Since the user has not specified a preference and has previously used 7.5, I see no reason to adjust this setting.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed all the rice first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables.
Food Items Left: There are rice, chicken, and carrots left on the plate. Their corresponding portions remaining are 1, 2, and 2 respectively.
Strategy: Given the user's preference, I'll prioritize finishing the rice before moving on to alternating between chicken and vegetables. Since the bite history shows a sequence of feeding rice, I'll continue to follow the user's preference order while considering the portion of the rice left.
Next food item: Since there is still a portion of rice left and the user's preference is to finish all the rice first, the next food item should be rice.
Next food item as string: 'rice'
Next bite size: Given no specific preference toward changing the bite size and observing a history of 5.0 bite sizes, the next bite size will remain as the default of 5.0.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has no explicitly stated preference, but consistently used parameters are observed from the bite history.
Strategy: Based on the bite history, the user has not indicated a preference for adjustments after consecutive uses of the same distance and exit angle settings for rice. Therefore, it is reasonable to continue using these parameters considering no feedback has indicated a need for change.
Next distance to mouth: Since there is no stated preference for adjustment and the bite history shows a consistent use of 7.5, this value will be used again.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed all the rice first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables.
Food Items Left: There are 2 portions of chicken and 2 portions of carrots left on the plate.
Strategy: Given that all the rice has already been fed, the strategy will be to alternate between chicken and vegetables, starting with chicken since both have equal portions remaining and abide by the user's preference of sequence post-rice.
Next food item: Since the last food item fed was rice and there are portions of both chicken and vegetables left, adhering to the user's preference, the next item should be chicken.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
Next bite size: No specific preference has been mentioned for altering the bite size; thus, the default value of 5.0, which has been consistent in the bite history, is chosen.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has shown no specific preference for adjustment of distance to mouth or exit angle based on previous bites, which have all been consistent with the default settings. As the next bite is chicken, which may have a different texture compared to rice but without a stated preference, standard defaults apply.

Strategy: Since there's no explicit preference mentioned, and previous history only includes rice with default parameters, it's reasonable to keep the settings consistent for chicken, anticipating that these parameters will adequately handle a variety of food types without specific adjustments.

Next distance to mouth: Based on the user's history and lack of specified preference, the default distance is maintained.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed rice first, followed by an alternation between chicken and vegetables.
Food Items Left: There are no portions of rice left, but there are 2 portions each of chicken and carrots remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Based on the preference and past behavior, now that all rice has been consumed, I will alternate between chicken and vegetables, starting with the vegetable (carrots) since the most recent bite was chicken.
Next food item: Since the last food item consumed was chicken and the user’s preference is to alternate between chicken and vegetables after the rice, the next logical choice is carrots. Carrots also have portions remaining, making them a viable option.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has no explicitly stated preference for distance to mouth or exit angle. Their bite history shows consistent parameters for different foods, sticking to the defaults of 7.5 for distance to mouth and 90.0 for exit angle.
Strategy: Since there's no stated preference and the bite history does not indicate any deviation from the defaults, it's reasonable to adhere to these settings. The uniformity in the user's previous bites suggests a satisfaction with these parameters across different food types.
Next distance to mouth: Given the user's history of maintaining the default setting and no specified preference, we will stick to the default value.

Summary: The user has shown no explicit preference regarding the distance to mouth and exit angle for their bites. The bite history indicates a consistent use of default settings (7.5 for distance to mouth and 90.0 for exit angle), including for different types of food such as rice, chicken, and carrots.

Strategy: Given the lack of explicit preference and the consistency in the previously used parameters, the best approach is to continue with the default settings. This ensures the user receives a similar eating experience to what they seem comfortable with, based on their bite history.

Next distance to mouth: Since there's been no indicated preference for the distance to mouth, and all previous bites used a distance of 7.5, we'll continue with this default value to maintain consistency.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: No preference has been noted for the exit angle, and previous bites were consumed with an exit angle of 90.0, which is the default setting. To ensure a similar eating experience, we will keep the exit angle the same.

Summary: The user wants to eat all the rice first, then alternate between chicken and vegetables.

Food Items Left: There are rice, chicken, and carrots remaining on the plate, each with 2 portions left.

Strategy: Since the user’s preference is to finish all the rice first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables, and considering the bite history shows rice was the last eaten, we proceed with the preference pattern. Given that rice still has portions remaining and should be finished first according to the user's preference, the next choice is straightforward.

Next food item: Since rice is the first priority and portions are still remaining, it should be chosen as the next food item to maintain adherence to the user's preferences and ensure all the rice is consumed before moving on to the next food type.
Next food item as string: 'rice'

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has no explicitly stated preference for the adjustment of the bite transfer parameters for consuming rice. The historical data shows consistent use of the default parameters with no adjustments, indicating either satisfaction with the current settings or no communicated variation in preference.

Strategy: Since the user has not communicated any specific preferences and the bite history shows two instances of using the default settings (7.5 for distance to mouth and 90.0 for exit angle), the strategy is to maintain these default parameters. This consistency suggests that the user is either satisfied with these settings or has not expressed a need for adjustment. Without explicit direction to adjust, adhering to the established parameters minimizes the risk of discomfort or inconvenience.

Next distance to mouth: No preference has been expressed, and previous bites have used the default setting without variation. This indicates satisfaction or at least no issue with the current setting, thus no change is warranted.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Similarly, there has been no feedback indicating a desire for change from the default exit angle, and previous uses have consistently utilized the default setting. Maintaining this setting aims to ensure continuity and satisfaction based on observed history.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers all of the rice to be fed first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables.

Food Items Left: There are rice, chicken, and carrots remaining on the plate, with portions left being 1 for rice and 2 for both chicken and carrots.

Strategy: The strategy is to first feed the remaining portion of rice, since the user's preference is to finish all of the rice first. After the rice is finished, we'll alternate between chicken and vegetables, as per the user's preference.

Next food item: Since there is still a portion of rice remaining, and the user has expressed a preference for eating all the rice first, the next food item should be rice. This is in line with the user's preference and takes into account the portions left for each food item.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The previous bites of rice have all been 5.0, and there's no preference stated that suggests changing this size. Therefore, we'll continue with the default bite size of 5.0 to maintain consistency with the user's apparent preference for bite size.

Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: Given the absence of explicit user preferences and a consistent history of using predetermined values, the user has neither expressed a preference for the distance to mouth nor the exit angle for their bites of rice.

Strategy: The strategy involves maintaining the previous settings due to the lack of explicit user feedback or preference changes. Given the bite history, it appears that the default settings of 7.5 for distance to mouth and 90.0 for the exit angle have been satisfactory. Without new input suggesting a desire for adjustment, repeating these optimized parameters ensures a comfortable and familiar feeding experience.

Next distance to mouth: Since there has been no indication of discomfort or preference for altering the spoon's distance to the mouth, and considering the repeated selection of 7.5 in the bite history, it is sensible to continue with this value. This approach follows the principle of consistency, aiming to provide a predictable and stable eating experience.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Similarly, the exit angle of 90.0 has been consistently used without any noted issues or preferences for change. Maintaining this angle supports a neutral tilt that likely facilitates an efficient and mess-free transfer of rice, considering no feedback has suggested otherwise.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference specifies feeding all of the rice first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables.

Food Items Left: On the plate, there are no more portions of rice left, but there are 2 portions each of chicken and carrots remaining.

Strategy: Given the user's preference and the remaining food items, the strategy involves first ensuring all rice is consumed, which has already been achieved according to the bite history. The next step follows the user's preference for alternation between chicken and vegetables, prioritizing what has not been fed yet since rice.

Next food item: Since all rice has been fed, and the preference is to alternate between chicken and vegetables, the next logical choice is chicken, as it has not been fed yet, and we need to follow the user's alternation preference starting with chicken after rice.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: No specific preference for changing the bite size has been stated, and the previous bites of rice were all at a size of 5.0. Therefore, it's reasonable to maintain this bite size for consistency.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is not explicitly stated, so we will derive insights from their bite history, which consists of uniform choices of distance_to_mouth and exit_angle for rice.

Strategy: Since the user has not specified preferences for the next bite of chicken, and all previous bites (rice) were handled with the same parameters (7.5 for distance_to_mouth and 90.0 for exit_angle), we will maintain these default parameters for the chicken bite.

Next distance to mouth: No explicit preference is indicated, and the bite history shows a consistent use of the default distance (7.5). In the absence of any indicated preference, we will stick with this value, assuming it has met the user's needs for the previous bites.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Similar to distance_to_mouth, there is no explicit preference for altering the exit angle, and the bite history reflects a consistent application of the default angle (90.0). We will maintain this angle for the chicken bite, presuming it has been satisfactory for the previous items.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference indicates that all of the rice should be fed first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables.

Food Items Left: On the plate, there are portions of chicken and carrots left, with 2 portions each.

Strategy: Since all rice has already been served and the most recent food item served was chicken, the next item should alternate to vegetables (carrots) according to the user's preference of feeding rice first, then alternating between chicken and vegetables.

Next food item: Given that the last item fed was chicken and adhering to the user's preference for alternation after rice, the logical choice is carrots, as it's the only vegetable remaining and adheres to the preference pattern.
Next food item as string: 'carrots'

Next bite size: Since there is no specific preference indicated for altering the bite size from the default of 5.0, and to maintain consistency with the user's previous bites without specific instruction to change, the bite size should remain at 5.0.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has not expressed a specific preference for distance to mouth or exit angle in the instruction. Therefore, we rely on the default settings and the consistencies observed in the bite history.

Strategy: Given the bite history shows a pattern of using the default settings of 7.5 for distance to mouth and 90.0 for exit angle across different foods including rice and chicken, we will continue to use these default parameters for serving carrots. There's no stated preference to necessitate deviations from these defaults.

Next distance to mouth: Since all previous bites used a distance of 7.5 with no indicated preference for adjustment, we will maintain this setting for consistency and lack of specific preference signals.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The exit angle for all previous bites has been 90.0, and without any expressed preference for adjusting this parameter, we will continue to use the default exit angle for ease of user acceptance and consistency.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to consume all the rice first, followed by alternating bites of chicken and vegetables.

Food Items Left: There are 2 portions each of chicken and carrots left on the plate, while all the rice has been consumed.

Strategy: Since all the rice has been consumed, and considering the user's preference to alternate between chicken and vegetables after the rice, the strategy will focus on alternating between the remaining chicken and vegetable portions. The last bite was from the carrots, so chicken comes next based on the alternating preference.

Next food item: Since the last food item consumed was carrots, obeying the user's preference to alternate between chicken and vegetables after finishing the rice, the next food item should be chicken. 

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: Based on the bite history, there's no specific preference indicating a need to adjust bite size away from the default. Therefore, the bite size will remain at the default value of 5.0.

Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has not explicitly stated a preference for the distance to mouth or the exit angle for spoon feeding. The bite history consists of items (rice, chicken, carrots) all served at the standard parameters (7.5 for distance_to_mouth and 90.0 for exit_angle).

Strategy: Given the lack of explicit preferences and the consistency in previously selected parameters for different food items, the default values of 7.5 for distance to mouth and 90.0 for exit angle will be maintained. This strategy prioritizes a neutral, middle-ground approach in the absence of specific user feedback or noticeable preferences within the given bite history.

Next distance to mouth: Since the user has not expressed a preference for the distance to mouth to be either closer or further, and the bite history shows a consistent setting of 7.5, this default value is chosen as it seems to be satisfactory for the user across different food types.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: No preference regarding the exit angle (higher, lower, or specific tilt) has been indicated, and all previous food items have been successfully served with an exit angle of 90.0. This suggests that the default setting is appropriate for the user's needs, leading to the decision to keep it unchanged.

Summary: The user's preference is to have all rice served first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables until these items are finished.

Food Items Left: There are no portions of rice left, 1 portion of chicken, and 2 portions of carrots left on the plate.

Strategy: Given the consumption sequence requires alternating between chicken and vegetables after the rice is finished, and considering the last food item fed was chicken, the next food item should be a vegetable to maintain the alternation preference.

Next food item: Since carrots are the only vegetables left and the preference dictates alternating between chicken and vegetables with chicken fed last, carrots should be the next food item served.
Next food item as string: 'carrots'
Next bite size: As there is no specific preference stated for changing the bite size from the default of 5.0 and to maintain consistency with the user's history without explicit instructions to deviate, the bite size should remain as 5.0.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user does not have a specific stated preference based on the provided information. All previous bites have been served with identical parameters: a distance to mouth of 7.5 and an exit angle of 90.0.

Strategy: Given the user's history indicates a consistent application of the default settings without expressed preference for adjustment, it's reasonable to continue with these parameters. The consistency suggests satisfaction or at least acceptance of these settings for a variety of food types, including rice, chicken, and carrots.

Next distance to mouth: There's no stated preference or prior evidence that suggests a need to deviate from the default setting of 7.5. All previous bites were served at this distance, indicating it's likely suitable for the user.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Similarly, there's no indicated preference for changing the exit angle. Previous meals have consistently used an exit angle of 90.0, which suggests it has been effective across different food types without issue.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have all the rice served first, followed by alternation between chicken and vegetables.

Food Items Left: There are remaining portions of chicken and carrots on the plate.

Strategy: Given the preference, since all rice has been eaten (indicated by its portion count being 0), the strategy involves alternating between chicken and vegetables since rice is no longer available.

Next food item: Looking at the bite history, the most recent items fed were chicken followed by carrots. According to the user's preference for alternation between chicken and vegetables, and given that both chicken and carrots still have remaining portions, the next food item to be fed should be chicken, maintaining the alternation sequence.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: There are no specific preferences stated regarding the size of the bites except for the default suggestion of 5.0. The bite history shows a consistent pattern of serving 5.0-sized bites without indications of a need for change. Therefore, we will continue with this size.

Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: Based on the bite history, there doesn't seem to be any explicit preference towards the distance to mouth or the exit angle. All previous parameters have remained consistent at the default values of 7.5 for distance_to_mouth and 90.0 for exit_angle across different food types (rice, chicken, carrots). 

Strategy: Given the absence of any explicit preference or adjustment cues in the provided history and input detail, I will stick to the default values for both parameters. This decision is grounded in the consistency observed in prior bites, suggesting a level of satisfaction or at least a lack of need for adjustment from the user's perspective.

Next distance to mouth: Since there's no indicated preference for bringing the spoon closer or moving it further away, and previous settings have always been at the default of 7.5, I'll maintain this value. It appears to be a suitable distance for a diverse range of food types including the next bite of chicken, indicating a level of comfort or convenience at this distance.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Similarly, there's no indication that the user has a preference for a higher or lower tilt-angle of the spoon upon exit from the mouth. With all previous exit angles consistently set at 90.0, this suggests the angle is appropriate for various types of food including the forthcoming chicken bite. Hence, I'll stick with this default angle.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have all the rice fed to them first, followed by an alternating pattern between chicken and vegetables.

Food Items Left: There are portions left for chicken and carrots on the plate.

Strategy: Since all the rice has already been consumed based on the user's preference and the bite history, and the pattern of alternating between chicken and vegetables has been followed, the decision on the next_food_item will be based on continuing this alternating pattern.

Next food item: The last food item fed was chicken; therefore, the next food item, according to the user's preference of alternating between chicken and vegetables, should be carrots, considering there is a remaining portion of it.

Next food item as string: 'carrots'

Next bite size: There has not been any specific preference stated for changing the bite size from the default of 5.0, and it aligns with previous bite sizes, maintaining consistency in portion size.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has not expressed a specific preference for either the distance to mouth or the exit angle for their spoonfuls of food. Their bite history shows consistent values of 7.5 for distance_to_mouth and 90.0 for exit_angle across different types of food including rice, chicken, and carrots.

Strategy: Given the lack of explicit preferences and the consistent history of settings used for various types of food, it is reasonable to continue using the same parameters that have been used previously. This approach ensures continuity and is likely to meet the user's expectations based on their prior experiences.

Next distance to mouth: There is no indication of any preference for changing the distance to mouth from what has been used previously. Therefore, maintaining the default setting of 7.5, which has been consistently used across all types of food, seems appropriate.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Similar to the reasoning for the distance_to_mouth, there is no expressed preference or historical variance regarding the exit angle. It has remained fixed at 90.0 across different food types. Thus, keeping the exit angle at the default value of 90.0 is justified based on prior usage.
