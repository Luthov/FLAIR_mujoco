=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to start with chicken, followed by vegetables, and end with rice.

Food Items Left: There are three food items left on the plate: chicken, spinach (a vegetable), and rice, each with two portions remaining.

Strategy: The strategy is to follow the user's preference order strictly, starting with the chicken, followed by the vegetable (spinach in this case), and ending with rice, ensuring to only suggest items that still have portions remaining.

Next food item: Since chicken is the first preference, has portions remaining, and there is no previous food item mentioned (as the bite history is empty), the next food item should be chicken according to the user's preferences.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: No specific preference for bite size is mentioned, so the default value of 5.0 is chosen.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to start feeding with the chicken, followed by vegetables, and end with the rice.

Food Items Left: There are servings remaining of chicken (2 servings), spinach (2 servings), and rice (2 servings).

Strategy: The strategy is to first complete feeding all portions of the current food item as per the user's preference before moving on to the next food item. Since the last bite was chicken, the priority remains on finishing the chicken servings if any remain.

Next food item: According to the user's preference and the history of bites taken, chicken was the last food item consumed and there are still portions left of it. The user's preference dictates to continue with chicken until all portions of it are finished before moving on to spinach and then rice. Therefore, chicken fits the criteria for the next food item to be fed.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: There's no specific preference mentioned for changing the bite size from the previously served bite; hence, we'll maintain the default used previously, which seems suitable unless instructed to adjust.
