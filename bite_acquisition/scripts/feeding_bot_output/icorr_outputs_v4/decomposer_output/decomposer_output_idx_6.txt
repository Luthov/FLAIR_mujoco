Alternate bites of rice, chicken, and vegetables without any repetition.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to alternate bites of rice, chicken, and vegetables without repeating the same food consecutively.

Food Items Left: There are 'rice', 'chicken', and 'carrots' left on the plate with each having 2 portions remaining.

Strategy: The high-level strategy involves rotating through the list of food items - rice, chicken, and vegetables - in the specific order without repetition, selecting the next item in the sequence with available portions.

Next food item: Since the bite history is empty, we don't have a previous food item to consider. Following the user's preference to alternate bites of rice, chicken, and vegetables without any repetition, and since all items are available, we start with the first item in the sequence, which is rice.
Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: Given there's no specific preference stated about altering the bite size from the default or cues indicating either a larger or smaller bite size preference, we will default to the standard bite size of 5.0.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Feed evenly without tilting the spoon.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to feed evenly without tilting the spoon, indicating an emphasis on maintaining a level spoon throughout the feeding process.

Strategy: Since the preference is to feed "evenly without tilting the spoon," we'll focus on maintaining a stable, flat orientation for the spoon. This preference directly impacts our exit angle decision more than the distance to mouth. Given rice as the next bite, ensuring it doesn't fall off before reaching the mouth is key, which can be aided by a careful balance in both parameters, especially the exit angle to minimize tilting.

Next distance to mouth: There's no specific preference indicating we should adjust the distance closer or further from the default of 7.5. Thus, we'll maintain the default distance since the emphasis is on not tilting the spoon, which doesn't directly relate to how close or far the spoon is from the mouth.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The preference to feed "evenly without tilting the spoon" suggests that the exit angle should be adjusted to ensure the food sits flatly on the spoon until it's safely delivered. Since the default is 90.0 degrees, which is a neutral tilt, and there's no prior bite history to suggest otherwise, maintaining this default should best align with the user's desire for an even, non-tilted delivery of the spoonful of rice.

Alternate bites of rice, chicken, and vegetables without repetition.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of rice, chicken, and vegetables without repetition. This means the feeding should follow a cycle through these food items, ensuring no item is repeated until all three have been served once in sequence.

Food Items Left: There are rice, chicken, and carrots remaining on the plate, each with 2 portions left. This means there are equal opportunities to feed any of these items according to the preference and the remaining portions.

Strategy: The high-level strategy involves following the user's preference for alternating bites of rice, chicken, and vegetables, making sure to move to the next food item in the sequence without repetition. Given the history shows the last item was rice, the next in the sequence, following the preference, should be chicken, if available, followed by vegetables.

Next food item: Since the last bite was rice, and the preference is to alternate between rice, chicken, and vegetables without repetition, the next logical choice based on the items left and portions available is to pick chicken as the next food item. It matches the sequential preference and there are portions of chicken available to be served.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: Since there's no specific preference stated about changing the bite size and the last bite size was 5.0, we will maintain this default size for consistency and because the user's preference does not specify a need to alter this.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Feed evenly without tilting the spoon.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed evenly without tilting the spoon, aiming for a straightforward feeding method without any inclination of the spoon to either side.

Strategy: Since the preference stresses not tilting the spoon, the exit angle should ideally be set to a neutral position that facilitates this even and untitled delivery of food. Given this, and considering no specific preference has been expressed regarding the distance to mouth, except to follow past successful attempts, we'll rely on the default or previously successful parameters as a guideline.

Next distance to mouth: There is no indicated preference to adjust the distance closer or further than what has been previously used. Therefore, it makes sense to stay with the previous setting that was presumably successful, especially in the absence of feedback to the contrary.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Given the user's preference for even feeding without tilt, and considering the default value aligns with such a preference, we will maintain the exit angle at the default or previously successful setting of 90.0. This ensures the spoon is oriented in such a way as to neither tilt upwards or downwards, adhering to the no-tilt preference.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of rice, chicken, and vegetables without repetition.
Food Items Left: The items remaining on the plate are rice, chicken, and carrots with corresponding portions all at 2.
Strategy: Given the user's preference for alternating between rice, chicken, and vegetables without repetition, and considering the bite history which shows the last bite was of chicken, the next logical choice following the sequence should be a vegetable. As carrots are the only vegetable option left and they align with the preference and have portions remaining, they should be selected next.
Next food item: Since the last food item consumed was chicken, and the preference is for alternating bites with no repetition, carrots will be the next food item, as it's the only vegetable left and fits the pattern.
Next food item as string: 'carrots'
Next bite size: There's no specific preference stated for altering the bite size from the default value of 5.0 based on user's history or request, so we will stick with the default.

Feed evenly without tilting the spoon.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to feed evenly without tilting the spoon, which means keeping the exit angle constant and not adjusting it for tilting purposes.

Strategy: Since the user's preference emphasizes not tilting the spoon and aiming for even feeding, and given the bite history has consistently used 7.5 for distance to mouth and 90.0 for exit angle, we'll maintain these values. These parameters have not only adhered to past preferences but also likely contributed to a successful feeding experience with different types of food (rice and chicken). As carrots may present a slightly different challenge due to their potential firmness or size compared to rice and chicken, sticking to the tried-and-true parameters will likely continue to ensure even feeding without modifying the spoon's tilting angle.

Next distance to mouth: Since the user's preference doesn't explicitly mention any desire to adjust the distance to the mouth, and the bite history shows a consistent use of 7.5, which aligns with the default and does not indicate any issues with feeding efficiency, we will keep it the same.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The emphasis on feeding evenly without tilting the spoon supports keeping the exit angle at its current setting, which is 90.0.
