Feed me only the rice, one spoonful at a time. Keep the bites large.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed only rice, one spoonful at a time, and desires for the bites to be large.

Food Items Left: The plate currently has portions of rice, peas, and corn, with each item having 2 portions remaining.

Strategy: Since the user has a specific preference for only being fed rice, my strategy will prioritize feeding rice over other items. Given that there's no request to alternate between different types of food and the user has not shown an interest in peas or corn, I will focus on serving rice until it's no longer available.

Next food item: The user's preference clearly states a desire for only rice to be fed. Since rice is available and has remaining portions, it is the logical choice to comply with the user's request.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The user's preference mentions keeping the bites large, which suggests choosing a value higher than the default. Since the default bite size is 5.0, and no specific value beyond 'large' is mentioned, I will select a value on the higher end but not the maximum to accommodate the preference.

Next bite size as float: 8.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has not specified any preference for the next bite of rice.

Strategy: Since there's no specific preference mentioned and no bite history to draw upon, I will stick to the default values for both parameters. These defaults are designed to accommodate a typical situation without any tailored adjustments.

Next distance to mouth: The default value of 7.5 is used because there's no expressed preference or previous bite information to suggest a change.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The default value of 90.0 is chosen due to the absence of any preference or historical data indicating a need for adjustment.

Next exit angle as float: 90.0

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed only rice, one spoonful at a time, and prefers large bites.

Food Items Left: There are three food items left on the plate - rice, peas, and corn, each with 2 portions remaining.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for rice and considering previous bites, the strategy is to continue feeding rice until its portions are exhausted, ensuring the bite size is considered large as per the user's preference.

Next food item: Since the preference is to be fed rice and there are still portions of rice remaining, the next food item to feed is rice. This adheres to the user's specific request and follows the history of previously chosen food items.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The user's preference indicates a liking for large bites, and considering the previous bite size for rice was 8.0 (which is large), it aligns with the user's preference to choose a similar large size.

Next bite size as float: 8.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has not expressed a specific preference for the distance to mouth or the exit angle for their bite of rice, based on the information provided.

Strategy: Since no specific preference was mentioned, the default parameters from the previous bite will be used. This assumes that the prior settings were satisfactory, and without feedback indicating a desire for change, replicating these conditions is the most logical approach.

Next distance to mouth: No preference was mentioned, so the default setting from the last bite will be used, which was 7.5.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: No preference was mentioned, so the default setting from the last bite will be used, which was 90.0.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed only rice, one spoonful at a time, with large bites.

Food Items Left: There are three types of food items left on the plate: rice, peas, and corn, with portions remaining of 1 for rice and 2 for both peas and corn.

Strategy: The strategy involves following the user's preference strictly by selecting rice as the next food item despite its remaining portion, before considering other items. The user's specific request for large bites is also prioritized in determining the bite size.

Next food item: Since the user's preference explicitly mentions feeding rice and the history shows previous bites were of rice, despite having just one portion of rice left, it aligns perfectly with the user preference to continue feeding rice. This decision adheres to the prioritization of the user's specific food preference and the fact that there’s still a remaining portion of rice.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The user's preference clearly states a desire for large bites, and the bite history reflects a precedent of selecting a value of 8.0. There is no indication to deviate from this established preference. Therefore, following the user's request for large bites, the same value is chosen.

Next bite size as float: 8.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has not expressed any specific preference for adjustments to either the distance to mouth or the exit angle for consuming rice. Their history shows consistent use of the default values for both parameters.

Strategy: Given the lack of explicit preferences and changes in the bite history, I'll recommend sticking with the default values for both parameters. This should ensure comfortable and familiar bite transfer for the next spoonful.

Next distance to mouth: No preference indicated, and previous bites have used the default setting. Hence, we continue with the default to maintain consistency and expected comfort.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Since there's no expressed preference for a change in tilt and past values have been at default, keeping the exit angle unchanged will likely yield a satisfactory experience, similar to previous bites.

Next exit angle as float: 90.0

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to be fed only rice, one spoonful at a time, and prefers the bites to be large.

Food Items Left: There are three items left on the plate: rice with 1 portion remaining, peas with 2 portions remaining, and corn with 2 portions remaining.

Strategy: The strategy for choosing the next_food_item will prioritize the user's preference for rice above all other food items. Considering the bite history shows a preference for large bites of rice, and there is still a portion of rice remaining, this should be the next choice.

Next food item: Based on the user's preference to be fed only rice and considering there is still one portion of rice remaining, the next food item should be rice. This aligns perfectly with the preference for rice and the bite history suggesting a pattern of eating rice in large bites.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The user's preference indicated a desire for large bites, and the bite history shows past bites were sized at 8.0. Thus, to match this expressed preference and historical pattern, the next bite size should also be considered large and consistent with previous bites.

Next bite size as float: 8.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has not expressed a specific preference for the distance to mouth or the exit angle for the spoon.

Strategy: Given the lack of expressed preference and consistent use of the same parameters (distance to mouth = 7.5, exit angle = 90.0) for rice in the bite history, it seems the user is satisfied with the default settings or has not found reason to request adjustments.

Next distance to mouth: Since there has been no indicated preference for adjusting the distance to mouth from what has been previously recorded (7.5), and the default distance has been consistently used, we will maintain this distance. This aligns with providing a consistent experience that the user appears accustomed to.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Similarly, there's been no feedback suggesting a need to change the exit angle from the default of 90.0, which has been consistently applied in all recorded instances. This suggests satisfaction with the current setting, or at least no identified need to alter it, so we will keep it unchanged to ensure continuity.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to only be fed rice, one spoonful at a time, and prefers the bites to be large.

Food Items Left: There are three food items left on the plate: rice, peas, and corn. However, the rice has been fully consumed (0 portions remaining), while peas and corn each have 2 portions remaining.

Strategy: The strategy is to respect the user's preference by prioritizing rice over other foods. Since rice is preferred but no portions are left, and no other food items were mentioned in the preference, I will adhere to the constraint of not providing food items that the user has not expressed a desire to eat.

Next food item: Given that all portions of the preferred food item (rice) have been consumed and the user's preference does not include peas or corn, and following the instruction to prioritize the user's preference, there is no sensible option left but to opt not to feed a bite.
Next food item as string: ''

Next bite size: Despite the user's preference for large bites, as there is no food item to be fed this time, the bite size becomes a moot point. However, should it be relevant, the user's history and preference suggest preferring a larger bite size.
Next bite size as float: 8.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: Since there's no explicitly stated preference from the user and the bite history consistently shows the use of the default parameters (7.5 for distance_to_mouth and 90.0 for exit_angle) for consuming rice, it can be inferred that the user is either satisfied with the default settings or has not expressed a preference for adjustments.

Strategy: Given the lack of explicit preferences and the consistency in previous parameters, the strategy will be to continue with the default settings. This approach assumes the user has found these settings satisfactory for eating rice or is currently exploring their preferences.

Next distance to mouth: There are no indications of a preference for changing the distance to mouth from the provided history or instructions. Therefore, the default value of 7.5, which has been consistently used, will be retained. This choice is based on assuming the user's satisfaction with the default settings due to their repetitive use.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Similarly, there is no feedback suggesting a need to alter the exit angle from the default of 90.0 degrees. The consistent use of this angle in the bite history suggests it is adequate for the user’s current needs, leading to the decision to maintain this exit angle.
