=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
One bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed in a specific order: first a bite of chicken, then two bites of rice. This sequence should be followed as closely as possible based on the available portions.

Food Items Left: There are portions of chicken, rice, and peas left on the plate, with 2 portions of each remaining.

Strategy: The high-level strategy is to follow the user's preference sequence while ensuring the selected food item has remaining portions. As preferences and available portions align, the choice of the next food item will be based on what has been fed most recently and the specified order preference. If the preference sequence is fully adhered to, it should loop back to the start (chicken) after completing a cycle (chicken, rice, rice).

Next food item: Since there is no bite history, meaning we haven't fed the user anything yet and all items have equal portions left, we follow the user's preference starting with chicken. This aligns with the instruction to prioritize the user's preference and the availability of portions for chicken.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
Next bite size: The preference does not specify a specific bite size different from the default, and since there is no bite history to suggest a deviation, we will use the default value of 5.0.

Feed with tilted spoonfuls.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed with spoonfuls that are tilted.

Strategy: Since there is a specific preference for "tilted spoonfuls," we will adjust the exit angle to reflect this. The distance to mouth will not be changed from the default value as there is no specific preference indicating it should be closer or further.

Next distance to mouth: No preference toward distance is given, so we'll stick with the default setting.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The preference for "tilted spoonfuls" suggests an adjustment to the exit angle for a more pronounced tilt. While the default is 90.0, indicating a neutral tilt, we will increase this value to encourage a more obvious tilted spoonful approach, which can help in handling the consistency of chicken.

One bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.

Food Items Left: There are three types of food items left on the plate, each with two portions remaining: chicken, rice, and peas.

Strategy: According to the user’s preference and the previous bite history, my strategy focuses on first addressing the preference sequence before moving on to any remaining items. Given the user's pattern of wanting chicken followed by rice, and considering what has already been served, I will continue to follow this sequence while ensuring there are portions left to be served.

Next food item: Since the last bite was of chicken and there's a preference for one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice, the next logical choice, respecting the preference and the remaining portions, would be rice to start fulfilling the "two bites of rice" part of the cycle. Rice still has portions remaining and fits the preference pattern.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: No specific preference for bite size has been stated other than the default size of the previous chicken bite, which was 5.0. Without further instructions to alter bite size, we will maintain this as the standard size for the next bite.

Feed with tilted spoonfuls.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed with tilted spoonfuls, indicating a preference for using a higher-than-default exit angle to facilitate easier eating.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for tilted spoonfuls, the exit angle should be adjusted to be higher than the default to accommodate this request. The history shows that the last bite used a higher exit angle (100.0 degrees), which aligns with the user's preference. Since there's no explicit preference regarding the distance to the mouth, it will remain at the default unless specified otherwise by the user's preference indications.

Next distance to mouth: Since the user's preference doesn't specify a need to adjust the distance to the mouth, and the bite history does not suggest an emerging preference, we will retain the default setting.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The user's preference for "tilted spoonfuls" indicates a need for a higher exit angle to ensure the food is delivered efficiently. Considering the previous bite was successful with an exit angle of 100.0 degrees, we'll use the same setting to maintain consistency with the user's evident satisfaction.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user’s preference is to have one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice in a repeating cycle.

Food Items Left: There are portions left of chicken, rice, and peas, each with two servings remaining.

Strategy: The strategy involves adhering to the user's specified order of consuming food items, meaning prioritizing feeding chicken followed by two bites of rice, while ensuring that the choice of the next food item has portions remaining.

Next food item: Given the bite history shows the last item eaten was rice, and considering the user's preference for a sequence of chicken followed by two bites of rice, the next food item should logically be chicken to restart the sequence. Since there are portions remaining of chicken, it aligns with both the user's preference and the availability of food items.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: No specific preference towards changing the bite size is mentioned. The default and the history suggest a bite size of 5.0, which has been used previously for chicken and fits within the user's accepted range.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Feed with tilted spoonfuls.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed with tilted spoonfuls, indicating a preference for a higher exit angle when receiving food.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for tilted spoonfuls and the consistent use of a 100.0 exit angle in the bite history for different types of food (chicken and rice), the approach will be to maintain a higher exit angle than the default. The preference does not specify a change in the distance to mouth, so that will remain at the default unless prior preferences suggested a change.

Next distance to mouth: Since the preference doesn’t specify a need to adjust the distance to the mouth and there's no indication the previous settings were unsatisfactory, we will keep it at the default setting. This ensures comfortable feeding without necessitating adjustments based on the provided preferences or bite history.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The preference explicitly mentions a liking for "tilted spoonfuls," which has been interpreted previously with an exit angle of 100.0 degrees for both chicken and rice. To align with this clearly preferred tilting method and considering the lack of direction towards either more or less tilt beyond what has been previously established, the exit angle will remain consistent with past preferences.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.

Food Items Left: There are 'chicken', 'rice', and 'peas' left on the plate with corresponding portions of 1, 2, and 2 left, respectively.

Strategy: The strategy is to adhere to the user's preference order and the quantity each item is to be served in sequence. Considering the preference and bite history, we look to continue matching the user's desired sequence.

Next food item: The last food item fed was 'chicken', the preference indicates to follow a bite of chicken with two bites of rice. Since rice still has portions remaining and follows the preference sequence, it's the next food item to choose.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: There is no specific request to alter bite size from the default 5.0, and the bite history does not suggest a preference for changing the bite size. Therefore, we'll continue with the default.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed with spoonfuls that are tilted. 

Strategy: Given the preference for tilted spoonfuls, we will adjust the exit angle to ensure the food is tilted more than the default. The bite history shows a repeated exit angle of 100.0 for both chicken and rice, indicating a satisfaction with this level of tilt previously. The distance to mouth has consistently been 7.5, and there's no specific preference indicated towards adjusting this value.

Next distance to mouth: Since the preference does not specify any adjustments towards the distance to mouth and previous values have consistently been 7.5, we will maintain this value. 

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The preference indicates a liking for "tilted spoonfuls" without specifying a direction but since the previous exit angles have been set to 100.0 which is above the default, and considering this provided satisfaction, it implies a preference for a higher tilt which we will maintain.

The user wants a sequence of one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user wants a feeding sequence of one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.

Food Items Left: The items remaining on the plate are chicken, rice, and peas with corresponding portions of 1, 1, and 2.

Strategy: My strategy involves adhering to the user’s specified preference of feeding a sequence of chicken followed by rice. Given the bite history and remaining portions, I will prioritize the next food item based on the sequence that’s been established while ensuring the chosen item still has portions remaining.

Next food item: The last food item fed was rice. According to the preference, after a bite of chicken, two bites of rice should follow. Since the last bite was of rice and considering the preference sequence, and the last element of rice from the sequence of one chicken followed by two rice has already been fulfilled, and given that there is one portion of chicken left but only one portion of rice to meet the two-rice preference, I should now prioritize feeding the remaining portion of chicken to start the preference cycle anew. However, considering the available portions, it seems we can only complete part of the next cycle starting with chicken, as there won't be enough rice to complete two more bites of rice afterward. Nonetheless, given the strict ordering from the preference and available portions, chicken is the sensible next choice.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: The preference does not specify wanting a smaller or larger bite size than previously, and the bite history shows a consistent bite size of 5.0. Without explicit instructions to adjust the size, I will default to the size that has been consistent in the bite history.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
The user prefers to be fed with tilted spoonfuls.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed with the spoon tilted more than the default angle suggests, indicating a preference for higher tilt angles during feeding.

Strategy: Since the user has a specific preference for "tilted spoonfuls," which implies a preference towards higher exit angles, and because the bite history shows a consistent choice of 100.0 degrees for exit angle, it is sensible to follow this cue for adjusting the exit angle. For the distance_to_mouth, the user has not expressed any specific preference, and the bite history shows a consistent value of 7.5, which suggests maintaining this distance as it falls within the default range and there's no indication that a change is desired.

Next distance to mouth: There is no expressed preference regarding the distance to the mouth, and the history supports keeping this constant at the previous settings.

One bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice in sequence.

Food Items Left: There are chicken, rice, and peas left on the plate, with their corresponding portions being one, one, and two respectively.

Strategy: The strategy is to adhere to the user's preference of eating sequence, which is one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice, while only suggesting items that have remaining portions. Considering the bite history, the pattern should continue if possible. However, given the remaining portions and the preference pattern, the focus is on what is left and can align with the preference within the constraint of available portions.

Next food item: Since the bite history shows alternating bites between chicken and rice, and based on the preference of having chicken followed by two bites of rice — and considering the available portions — the next logical item to choose is rice, as there’s no chicken portion left to continue the exact pattern of preference but continuing with rice aligns with the sequential component of the preference.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: Given that the bite size preference isn't very specific and always defaults to 5.0 in the bite history, and there's no specific instruction to adjust the bite size based on food type or user's past preferences; thus, the bite size will remain at the default of 5.0.

Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Feed me with tilted spoonfuls.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference indicates a desire for spoonfuls of food to be served with a tilt.

Strategy: To adhere to the user's preference for tilted spoonfuls, the exit angle needs to be adjusted accordingly. The preference suggests an inclination towards a higher tilt, without specifying how much higher. Given the consistent previous exit angle of 100.0 for both rice and chicken, and in the absence of a specific angle request, this angle appears to be a preferred value for achieving a "tilted spoonful."

Next distance to mouth: There is no specific preference stated for changing the distance to the mouth. The previous instances have consistently used a distance of 7.5, which does not suggest a need for adjustment based on the user's preference. Therefore, it sticks to the default or historically used value.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Since the user's preference is for tilted spoonfuls and considering the historical choice of 100.0 for both rice and chicken, which seems to align with this preference, this value will be continued. It represents a tilt, adhering to the user's wishes, and seems to be acceptable based on previous selections.

One bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is for a feeding pattern that alternates between one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.

Food Items Left: There are 'chicken', 'rice', and 'peas' left on the plate, with portions remaining for each being 1, 1, and 2, respectively.

Strategy: Given the user's preference and looking at the bite history, the next_food_item will be chosen based on the sequence of feeding (one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice) while ensuring that there are portions left of the chosen food item. The bite history suggests a pattern is being followed, and the strategy will continue to follow this pattern.

Next food item: Since the last item fed was rice and the feeding pattern is one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice, the next logical choice, assuming the pattern continues and based on remaining portions, should be 'chicken'. However, there seems to be a deviation in the bite history from the stated preference of one chicken followed by two rice, showing a pattern of chicken-rice repeated. Despite this deviation, following the stated preference directly and given that there are portions of chicken and rice left, the correct move in alignment with the initial preference would have been another bite of rice to accurately follow a sequence of two bites of rice after each chicken. Nevertheless, given the alternation evident in the bite history, but with an imperative to closely adhere to the preference which has potentially already been inaccurately reflected upon inspection of previous actions, and considering available portions where each food item still has at least one portion left, it introduces a contradiction in following the stated preference strictly. Therefore, the immediate next choice based on preference would ideally be 'rice' to correct the pattern towards the stated preference, but the historical data suggest a deviation from these instructions. However, adhering strictly to the input instruction and the pattern stated in the preference without considering the bite history misalignment, and noting the portions available where both chicken and rice have portions available but trying to realign back to preference which indicates a necessity for considering portions and attempts at readjustment, the choice becomes ambiguous without a direct instruction for correction upon deviation. Thus, it prompts a selection based on remaining portions but under the constraint of adhering to preference and precedence, leading to an option to pause and evaluate, potentially suggesting '' due to the contradiction between stated preference alignment and previous action patterns combined with the current understanding of portion availability and preference adherence.

Feed me with tilted spoonfuls.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed with spoonfuls that are tilted, suggesting favor toward adjustments in the exit_angle parameter to accommodate a tilted spoon approach over the default setting.

Strategy: Given the preference for tilted spoonfuls and the consistent exit angle of 100.0 in the bite history, it seems appropriate to maintain this value for exit_angle, acknowledging the preference for a tilt that is higher than the default of 90.0. Since there is no specific preference stated for the distance_to_mouth and the previous values have consistently been 7.5, maintaining this distance is logical to ensure comfort and consistency in feeding.

Next distance to mouth: Since there is no explicit preference indicating a need to change the distance_to_mouth from its previous values, and given that the user’s preference does not specifically mention distance but rather tilt, it is appropriate to keep it at the same level used historically and default, which appears satisfactory.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The preference for "tilted spoonfuls" directly influences the exit_angle. Looking at the bite history, an exit_angle of 100.0 has been consistently used. This value aligns with the user's preference for a tilted spoon angle over the straighter default angle of 90.0, indicating that a tilt, specifically at 100.0 degrees, has been preferable and should continue to be employed.
