=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Only vegetables are to be selected, and the user prefers small bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers only vegetables and wants the bites to be small.

Food Items Left: There are three food items left on the plate: beef, rice, and cabbage, each with two portions remaining.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for vegetables, the choice is straightforward. Among the remaining food items, only cabbage qualifies as a vegetable. Thus, the selection process will prioritize the user's dietary preferences, focusing on vegetable items and ignoring non-vegetable items, regardless of the efficiency or portions remaining for those non-preferred types of food.

Next food item: Since cabbage is the only vegetable on the list, and considering the user's preference for vegetables only, cabbage is the selected item for the next food. There are portions remaining for cabbage, aligning with the requirement to only suggest food items that still have portions left. 

Next food item as string: 'cabbage'

Next bite size: The user prefers small bites. Although the default bite size is 5.0, adjusting the bite size lower aligns with the stated preference for smaller bites. Since the preference specifically mentions a desire for small bites, a value smaller than the default is selected to accommodate this request.

None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: Since the user has not provided any specific preferences and there is no bite history available, default settings will be used to determine the parameters for serving the next bite of cabbage.

Strategy: In the absence of express preferences or historical data to suggest adjustments, the default parameter values will be maintained for both distance to mouth and exit angle. This approach ensures a standard delivery method that can serve as a baseline for future adjustments based on user feedback or explicit preferences.

Next distance to mouth: Since there is no stated preference or historical data indicating the user's liking for a closer or further distance, the default distance is chosen to ensure comfort and manageability of the bite.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Without any indication of a preference for a higher or lower tilt and in the absence of prior bite data suggesting a more suitable exit angle, the default exit angle is retained to facilitate a straightforward and neutral spoon feeding position.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers only vegetables and wants them in small bites.

Food Items Left: The plate currently has beef, rice, and cabbage, with 2 portions of each remaining.

Strategy: Prioritizing the user's preference for vegetables in small bites, we will focus on the vegetable option available, ignoring non-vegetable food items. Since cabbage is the only vegetable mentioned and aligns with the user's preferences, it will be prioritized.

Next food item: Since cabbage is the only vegetable available and matches the user's preference for vegetables, and it still has portions remaining, it is the logical choice. The previous bite also included cabbage, indicating the user's ongoing preference for this item.
Next food item as string: 'cabbage'

Next bite size: Given the user's specific request for small bites and the history showing a previous cabbage bite size of 2.0, which aligns with the smaller bite preference, we will continue with this size.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: Since there is no explicitly stated preference for the next bite, user preference will need to be deduced from the history and available instructions. Given there's only one historical entry with the default parameters used, no clear preference can be concluded.

Strategy: Given the absence of direct user preference and based on the single historical entry for cabbage with default parameters (7.5 for distance to mouth and 90.0 for exit angle), the strategy will be to repeat these default parameters. This approach assumes that in the absence of feedback, the previous settings were satisfactory. However, if feedback were given, adjustments would be considered to enhance the eating experience according to the user's likes or dislikes.

Next distance to mouth: There are no indications of a preference towards a closer or further distance. Therefore, adhering to the default value is the chosen approach, in line with the previous successful bite.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Without specific feedback on the desire for a higher or lower tilt, it is prudent to stay with the default exit angle, which presumably provided a satisfactory bite previously.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
The user only wants vegetables and prefers small bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to eat only vegetables and likes to have them in small bites.

Food Items Left: There are three types of food items remaining on the plate: beef (2 portions), rice (2 portions), and cabbage (1 portion).

Strategy: The strategy involves prioritizing the user's preferences for vegetables over other types of food and considering the size of the bites they prefer. Since the user has already been fed cabbage and appreciates small bites, I will focus on selecting the vegetable option available, respecting both the preference for type and bite size.

Next food item: As cabbage is the only vegetable left and there's still a portion remaining, and aligning with the user’s preference for vegetables, the next food item to be served should be cabbage. This choice is straightforward since it is the only option that fits within the specified preference for vegetables.

Next food item as string: 'cabbage'

Next bite size: Since the preference advises for small bites and previous servings of cabbage were in the size of 2.0, which aligns with the user’s preference and there's no indication that this was unsatisfactory, maintaining this bite size is logical to ensure consistency and adherence to the user's preference.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has not expressed a specific preference for the distance to mouth or the exit angle based on the information provided.

Strategy: Since there are no specific preference cues provided, and the bite history shows consistent values for both distance to mouth and exit angle across the two samples of eating cabbage, the strategy is to stick with these previously used parameters. This approach aims to maintain a consistent experience for the user, assuming the lack of feedback on previous bites suggests satisfaction with those settings.

Next distance to mouth: There is no expressed preference to adjust the distance to mouth, and the history shows repeated use of 7.5. Hence, it seems appropriate to continue with this value, assuming it has been satisfactory.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: With no direction to change the exit angle and a history of it being set at 90.0, it makes sense to keep this angle. This consistency might suggest that the current setup is comfortable for the user or has otherwise met their needs.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has a preference for only eating vegetables and desires to be fed in small bites.

Food Items Left: There are three food items remaining: beef, rice, and cabbage with portions remaining as 2, 2, and 1 respectively.

Strategy: Since the user only wants vegetables and prefers them in small bites, the strategy will be to prioritize feeding the vegetable item left on the plate. The user's recent bites indicate a previous focus on cabbage, which aligns with their vegetable preference, and thus this will guide the food item selection. We will also consider the portion sizes left to ensure the choice aligns with the remaining inventory.

Next food item: Given the user's preference for only vegetables, the only remaining vegetable is cabbage. Since cabbage still has a portion remaining, it is the sensible option.
Next food item as string: 'cabbage'
Next bite size: The user prefers to be fed in small bites and the bite history suggests that a size of 2.0 has previously been chosen. To align with this preference for small bites, the same value will be selected.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has no explicitly stated preference for either the distance to mouth or the exit angle for spoon-feeding, based on the given history.

Strategy: Without explicit preferences or indications from the user that the default settings were unsatisfactory or could be improved upon, the most prudent course of action is to maintain the parameters that have been consistently used. This assumes that the lack of change request or feedback following previous bites suggests the user found the settings satisfactory or at least acceptable.

Next distance to mouth: Given no expressed preference or feedback indicating a desire for adjustment, and in following the principle of maintaining the status quo in the absence of directives to the contrary, the distance to mouth will remain unchanged. This maintains consistency with the bite history.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Similarly, the exit angle will be kept at its previous setting, as there are no cues indicating a preference for adjusting the tilt of the spoon. This decision echoes the rationale for maintaining the current distance to mouth, prioritizing consistency in the user's experience.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
The user prefers only vegetables in small bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers only vegetables in small bites.

Food Items Left: On the plate, there are 'beef' and 'rice' left with 2 portions each, while 'cabbage', which is a vegetable, has no portions remaining.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference for vegetables and small bites, the strategy should prioritize any remaining vegetables. Since there are no vegetables left with portions remaining, we must carefully consider the preference to ensure a user’s satisfaction even if it might mean not offering a bite.

Next food item: Since 'cabbage' is the preferred vegetable, but it has no portions left, and the user does not prefer beef or rice, the logical choice here, respecting the user's preferences, is not to offer any other food item. This decision prioritizes the user's dietary preference for vegetables over the other available food options.

Next food item as string: ''

Next bite size: The user prefers small bites, and the history indicates that prior bites of 'cabbage' were taken at a size of 2.0. Although no food item will be offered in this instance, maintaining a record of the preferred bite size could ensure consistency for future reference. However, as we are not suggesting a bite here, the adjustment to bite size is not applicable.

Summary: The user has not expressed a specific preference for the distance to mouth or the exit angle based on the provided input details.

Strategy: Given the lack of explicit preference and the consistent historical data of using a distance_to_mouth of 7.5 and an exit_angle of 90.0 for cabbage, we will adhere to these settings for the next bite. The consistency in previous bites suggests these settings are satisfactory, or at the very least, acceptable for consuming cabbage.

Next distance to mouth: Since there is no expressed preference and all previous bites have maintained a distance_to_mouth of 7.5, we will continue with this default value to ensure consistency and presumed user satisfaction.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: With no specific preference indicated and a consistent exit_angle of 90.0 used for previous cabbage bites, we will keep the exit_angle at 90.0. This consistency aligns with a neutral tilt level that is likely suitable for the user.
