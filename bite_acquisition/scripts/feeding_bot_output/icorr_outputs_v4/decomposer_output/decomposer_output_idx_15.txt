Give me larger bites of chicken, followed by smaller bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers larger bites of chicken first, then smaller bites of rice, with no preference mentioned for peas.
Food Items Left: There are chicken, rice, and peas left on the plate, each with remaining portions of 2.
Strategy: According to the user's preference, the strategy is to first feed all portions of chicken with larger bites, followed by rice with smaller bites. Peas will be considered last since there's no specific preference mentioned for them.
Next food item: Since there's no bite history which could influence the decision - and all items still have portions remaining - the preference directly dictates the choice. The user has specified a desire for chicken first. Given this and the fact that chicken is still available, it is the sensible choice.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
Next bite size: The preference clearly specifies larger bites for chicken. While no exact size is given, the term "larger" suggests choosing a value above the default. Given the scale from 1.0 to 10.0, a significantly larger bite might be advisable. Since 'larger' is relative but hasn't been previously quantified, opting for a value at the upper range seems suitable, yet without specific preference detail, a moderately higher value than default should be safe.

Feed me with a tilt in the spoon and do not come too close to me.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to receive their spoonfuls of food with a noticeable tilt and desires the spoon to not come too closely to them during feeding.

Strategy: To adhere to the user's preferences, I will adjust the parameters by choosing a distance farther from the default to respect their comfort with space. For the exit angle, a value higher than the default will be selected to introduce the desired tilt effect during feeding.

Next distance to mouth: The preference clearly states "do not come too close to me," which implies a setting further than the default. Therefore, it is prudent to increase the distance beyond the default of 7.5.

Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5

Next exit angle: Given the preference for "a tilt in the spoon," the exit angle should be adjusted to a higher value than the default to achieve the specified tilt. This encourages a more angled approach, which aligns with the user's desire.

Give larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have larger bites of chicken first, followed by smaller bites of rice. There is no specific preference mentioned regarding peas, implying it should be served last or as per the general rules of efficiency and remaining portions without a specific order or bite size preference.

Food Items Left: There are three types of food items left on the plate: chicken, rice, and peas, each with 2 servings remaining.

Strategy: The high-level strategy revolves around prioritizing the user's preferences for food order and bite sizes, supplemented by the requirement to serve food items with remaining portions. Given the preference and the bite history, we will continue serving chicken with a larger bite size until its portions are depleted before moving to rice with a smaller bite size.

Next food item: Since there are still portions of chicken remaining and the user's preference states to give larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice, the next food item should be chicken. This decision aligns with respecting the user's stated preference order and the availability of portions for chicken.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: The preference mentions larger bites for chicken, and the previous bite size given for chicken was 7.5, which is considered a larger bite according to the defined scale. To maintain consistency with the preference for larger bites, we will choose a value that is considered large but not necessarily larger than the previous one, as the exact terminology does not specify increasing sizes but consistently larger ones. Therefore, maintaining the same size as the previous large bite seems appropriate.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers feeding with a tilt in the spoon while maintaining some distance during the feeding.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for a tilt in the spoon and to maintain some distance, the parameters for the next bite should reflect a slight adjustment towards these preferences based on the most recent bite history.

Next distance to mouth: The user's preference mentions maintaining some distance, which aligns with the previous setting of 8.5, suggesting that the user was satisfied with this distance since there's no specific direction to move closer or further. Consequently, we will maintain this distance to honor the preference and previous satisfactory experience.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice, implying a specific order and size for bites depending on the food item.

Food Items Left: On the plate, there are portions of chicken, rice, and peas remaining, with each having 1 portion of chicken and 2 portions of rice and peas respectively.

Strategy: The strategy will prioritize feeding chicken in larger bites until it's finished, adhering to the user's preference, before moving onto the next preferred item, which is rice, to be served in smaller bites. Peas have not been mentioned in the preference, and thus, will be considered last.

Next food item: Considering the preference for larger bites of chicken has been partially met as seen in the bite history, and there's still a portion of chicken left, the next item should continue to be chicken to align with the user's preference and the fact that it aligns with completing one food item before moving onto the next. 

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: The preference explicitly states "larger bites of chicken," so we should maintain the larger size similar to what's been previously served for chicken, which is 7.5 based on the bite history.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed with a tilt in the spoon and prefers the spoon not to come too close to them.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference for a tilt and not wanting the spoon too close, and considering the previous bite parameters that indicate a specific preference, the decision for the next spoonful of food parameters will align with these cues.

Next distance to mouth: Since the user prefers the spoon not to come too close, and the previous bites had a distance set to 8.5, which is further than the default but still within the preference range, we will maintain this distance. It respects the user's preference and follows the consistency of their prior experiences.

Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5

Next exit angle: The preference indicates a desire for a tilt in the spoon, and the meal's previous exit angles were at 100.0, which is higher than the default and aligns well with the inclination for a tilt.

Give larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers larger bites of chicken first, followed by smaller bites of rice. No specific preference is provided for peas, implying they are the least preferred or to be fed after chicken and rice.

Food Items Left: There are portions left of chicken, rice, and peas on the plate, with 1 portion of chicken, 2 portions of rice, and 2 portions of peas remaining.

Strategy: Since the preference is to give larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice, and considering the portions left, the strategy will first aim to complete serving the remaining portion of chicken. The bite history shows a trend of serving chicken with a bite size of 7.5, suggesting the user's preference for larger bites of chicken has been previously honored consistently.

Next food item: Given the user's preference and the remaining portions, the next food item should continue to be chicken, completing the preferred sequence before moving to the next prioritized item, which is rice. Since there is still one portion of chicken left, it should be chosen next to adhere to the user's preference sequence.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: The preference indicated larger bites of chicken, and the bite history confirms that previous bites of chicken were sized 7.5, aligning with the "larger bites" preference. There's no indication to adjust from this pattern; hence, the next bite size should continue to follow this established preference.

Feed with a tilt in the spoon and do not come too close.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to approach with a tilt and not to be too close to them while being fed.

Strategy: To adhere to the user's preference for a tilted spoon and not being too close, adjustments to the exit angle and distance to the mouth parameters must reflect these desires. The user's satisfaction with previous parameters suggests they are comfortable with both the tilt and distance used recently.

Next distance to mouth: Since the user prefers not to come too close and the bite history consistently shows a distance of 8.5, which is further than the default but not at the maximum, this distance seems well-suited to the user's comfort and preference and will be maintained.

Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5

Next exit angle: The user's preference for a tilt in the spoon is met by adjusting the exit angle to create a comfortable feeding action. The bite history reveals a consistent exit angle of 100.0 degrees, indicating a preference for a higher tilt than the default. This specific angle appears to meet the user's need for a tilt and will be continued.

Larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice. 

Food Items Left: There are three food items left on the plate: chicken (0 portions), rice (2 portions), and peas (2 portions).

Strategy: Since all portions of chicken have been consumed, and the preference states to feed chicken before rice, and given there's no chicken left, the next item should be rice, following the user's preference order and considering what's available on the plate.

Next food item: Since chicken is finished and the preference is to move to rice after chicken, the next food item should be rice. 

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The user prefers smaller bites for rice, contrasting with the previous larger bites of chicken. Therefore, selecting a value smaller than the last chicken bite size of 7.5, yet within the specified user preference of smaller bite size for rice, a value towards the smaller end of the scale is chosen.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Feed with a spoon tilt and maintain some distance during feeding.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers feeding with a spoon tilt and maintaining some distance during feeding.

Strategy: Given the preference for maintaining some distance, it's reasonable to select a distance that's not too close, acknowledging the preference for "some distance." Since the previous bites with chicken were served at a distance of 8.5, which presumably met the user’s satisfaction for distance, this can guide the decision for the next bite of rice. For the spoon tilt, the preference mentions a tilt but does not specify higher or lower, indicating satisfaction with the concept of tilt rather than a specific angle. The previous exit angle of 100.0 degrees has been consistently used, suggesting that this angle likely meets the preference for a spoon tilt adequately.

Next distance to mouth: The preference for maintaining some distance during feeding and the successful history of feeding at a distance of 8.5 suggest using the same value to meet the user's preference.

Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5

Next exit angle: Given the user's preference for a spoon tilt without specifying higher or lower, and considering the consistent use of an exit angle of 100.0 degrees in the bite history, it seems this angle is preferable and should be used again.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers larger bites of chicken and then prefers smaller bites of rice. No mention of peas suggests no specific preference for peas.

Food Items Left: There are no more portions of chicken left, but there are 2 portions each of rice and peas remaining on the plate.

Strategy: Since the chicken is finished and the user prefers larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice, the next item to prioritize is rice, following the specific preference order. Peas will be considered last since there's no specified preference for them, and the chicken, which is the user's top preference, is already finished.

Next food item: Given the user's preference for rice following chicken and considering that chicken portions are finished, rice is the natural choice. Furthermore, the last bite was rice, indicating it's appropriate to continue with rice to respect the preference hierarchy and the continuity of the meal experience.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The user prefers smaller bites for rice, as indicated by their preference and reflected in the bite history with the last rice bite being a 3.0. Hence, we'll continue with this smaller size to align with the user's expressed preference.
