=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
One bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference indicates a sequential feeding pattern where one bite of chicken is to be fed before two bites of rice are given. This sequence prioritizes feeding chicken before rice, adhering to a specific order and amounts before moving onto the next food item.

Strategy: To align with the user's preference and the portion remaining, the first step is to check the portions of each food item left and follow the preference order. Since there's no bite history suggesting a deviation from the default bite size or the initial sequence, the sequence should start with chicken, followed by rice, as per the preference. Given that all items have equal portions remaining and efficiency, and there's no specific preference indicated for bite size, the default bite size should be applied.

Next food item: Since the preference indicates starting with chicken and there's no bite history to indicate previous feeding, chicken should be the first item to feed. The portions remaining indicate there are 2 portions of chicken left, which aligns with the need to start feeding chicken.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: No specific preference for bite size alteration was provided. Thus, the default bite size of 5.0 will be used, as it's the standard unless instructed otherwise.

Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Feed me with tilted spoonfuls.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed with the spoon tilted.
Strategy: Given the preference for tilted spoonfuls without a specific angle mentioned, and no history to base adjustments on, we will meet the request by choosing an exit angle that suggests a noticeable tilt beyond the default. The distance_to_mouth parameter will remain unchanged as the preference doesn't specify a need to adjust how close or far the spoon is.
Next distance to mouth: No specific preference stated for distance, so we default to the standard distance.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: Preference indicates a tilt is desired, implying a need for an angle different from the default, suggesting a higher tilt for better user experience.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
One bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user’s preference is to have one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice in a sequence.

Strategy: Given the user's preference and the recorded bite history, the strategy is to follow the sequence of feeding preferences while keeping track of Portions remaining. Since the bite history indicates the last bite was chicken, and given the preference sequence, the next item should be rice to start fulfilling the two-bite preference of rice following the chicken. Portions remaining are {'chicken': 2, 'rice': 2, 'peas': 2}, indicating all items still have remaining portions. Since there is no specific preference stated for bite sizes to deviate from the default or previous bite size, and no indication to adjust from the previous size of 5.0, we will maintain this bite size.

Next food item: Following the preference of having two bites of rice after a bite of chicken and considering that rice still has portions remaining, the next bite should come from the rice to align with the user's sequence preference.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: There is no indicated preference to adjust the bite size away from what was previously used or from the default; hence, we maintain the previous bite size value of 5.0.

Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Use tilted spoonfuls.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers using a tilted spoonful for each bite.
Strategy: Based on the preference for tilted spoonfuls and the history suggesting a higher tilt has been used, the exit angle should be adjusted to reflect this preference. The last exit angle was set to 100.0, suggesting a tilt preference above the default. Since there's no specific mention to adjust the distance to mouth based on preference, it will remain at the default unless the history suggests a different optimization for this specific type of food, which it does not.
Next distance to mouth: No specific preference indicated; therefore, the default value is used.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: Preference indicates a tilt, and historical data suggests a tilt above the default. Continuing with a similar tilt for rice, which likely benefits from a careful approach to prevent spillage.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
One bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to have one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice, in a repeating sequence.

Strategy: Since the preference states an explicit order of food items to be fed (chicken followed by rice in a specific sequence) and given the portions remaining for each item ([2, 2, 2] for chicken, rice, and peas respectively), the strategy revolves around adhering to this preference while considering the portions left. The bite history indicates that the last food item fed was rice, and according to the user's preference, the next food item should be rice again, to complete the sequence of "one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice" before moving on to the next sequence. The bite size will default at 5.0 since no specific size preference was stated.

Next food item: Following the preference and given that we have already fed chicken and then rice, and knowing we need two bites of rice in succession before moving back to chicken, the next food item should be rice again to adhere to the user's preference pattern and considering we still have portions of rice remaining.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: Since no specific preference towards bite size was mentioned other than the default size given in the bite history, we will maintain the bite size at 5.0, the default value, for consistency.

Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Feed me with tilted spoonfuls.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers tilted spoonfuls of food.
Strategy: Since the user's preference emphasizes 'tilted spoonfuls' without a specific direction to tilt further or less, we'll look at the exit angle from the bite history to guide our decision. The distance_to_mouth has no stated preference for adjustment, so it will remain at the default unless specified otherwise.
Next distance to mouth: No specific preference towards distance is stated; thus, the default value is adopted.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: The preference for 'tilted spoonfuls' alongside the consistent choice of a 100.0 exit angle from the bite history suggests maintaining this angle aligns with the user's preferences for tilt.

One bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to have one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice. They have not specified a preference for peas, implying it should be eaten last if at all within the order of preference. 

Strategy: Since the user's preference is to eat chicken followed by two bites of rice, and given the bite history, the order so far has been followed. Given the portions remaining, chicken still has portions left and should be the next item to follow the preference correctly. The portions remaining are: chicken (2), rice (1), peas (2). Since chicken has not been fully consumed and aligns with the user's preference to have chicken before multiple bites of rice, it is the logical choice for the next bite.

Next food item: Based on the preference and portions remaining, there are still portions of chicken available, making it the appropriate choice to honor the user's eating sequence. 
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
Next bite size: Since no specific preference on bite size is stated and the default is 5.0, which has been used in the past without any noted user preference for change, the bite size will remain the same.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Feed with tilted spoonfuls.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers feedings with tilted spoonfuls, indicating a preference for a higher exit angle from the spoon.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference for tilted spoonfuls and the bite history showing a consistent exit angle of 100.0, which is higher than the default, we will align with both the user's general preference and their specific history of exit angles. The distance to mouth has stayed constant at 7.5 in the bite history, and since there was no explicit preference indicating a change in distance, it will remain unchanged.

Next distance to mouth: Since there is no specific preference indicating a change in distance to mouth and the bite history consistently shows 7.5, we will keep it at that.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

One bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice in their feeding sequence.

Strategy: Based on the preference and portions remaining, we must follow the sequence of feeding one portion of chicken followed by two portions of rice. The bite history indicates previous bites have been made following this pattern. Given the current portions remaining for each item ('chicken': 1, 'rice': 2, 'peas': 1) and the user's preference, the next item should be chicken to adhere to the sequence and because there's still a portion of chicken remaining. The bite size has been consistently 5.0, and no preference for changing it has been expressed, so it will remain the same.

Next food item: Based on preference and portions remaining, 'chicken' is chosen to match the sequence and because it's still available.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
Next bite size: No preference was specified for changing the bite size, so it remains at the default of 5.0, consistent with the bite history.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed with spoonfuls that are tilted.
Strategy: Since the preference clearly indicates a desire for tilted spoonfuls and the bite history shows a consistent exit angle of 100.0 for both chicken and rice, it is reasonable to maintain this pattern. The distance to mouth has remained unchanged, suggesting the current setting meets the user's needs.
Next distance to mouth: There is no indication that the user desires a change in the distance, so it remains at the default.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
One bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user’s preference indicates a specific sequence where one bite of chicken is to be followed by two bites of rice. This sequence is intended to be repeated.

Strategy: Based on the preference, the sequence of feeding should be chicken followed by two bites of rice. However, considering the portions remaining and the bite history, it seems we have already provided this sequence twice, and the portions for chicken are depleted (0 portions of chicken remaining because the original portions are not explicitly given, but the bite history suggests chicken has been served three times which likely meets or exceeds the available portion, and under the instruction to not use bite history to directly infer consumption, we'll adhere to direct portion indications next). Given the remaining portions of rice and peas and adhering to the preference as closely as possible, the next logical choice should default to rice since peas were not part of the stated preference order, and there are portions of rice remaining.

Next food item: Since the preference is to feed chicken followed by rice and chicken is presumably finished (based on the assumption from bite history and instructions for making decisions), the next food item following the preference order (while respecting portions available) would be rice, given that there are still portions of rice left to consume.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: No direct preference for bite size changes was mentioned, so the bite size should default to the previously used size of 5.0, which aligns with the user’s prior experiences and the default setting.

Feed with tilted spoonfuls.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed with tilted spoonfuls, suggesting a preference for a certain exit angle to ensure comfortable and effective feeding.
Strategy: The user's explicit preference is for tilted spoonfuls, which suggests adjusting the exit angle to meet this requirement. Given the historic exit angles have consistently been at 100.0, which is higher than the default, it seems this degree of tilt aligns with their preference. There's no mention of a preference for adjusting the distance to mouth, so this will remain at the default value unless indicated otherwise.
Next distance to mouth: There is no specific user preference indicating a change is needed, so it will stay at the default setting.

The user wants a specific sequence of eating: one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers a specific sequence of eating, which is one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference for a specific sequence of eating, the next food item should be either chicken or rice in adherence to the sequence. Since the bite history shows alternating patterns of chicken and rice and considering the portions remaining, we adhere to the preference sequence. Given the portions remaining for each item being chicken (1), rice (1), and peas (2), and noting the last bite was rice, the next food item in sequence according to preference should ideally be chicken. However, observing the portions remaining, chicken has one portion left, which aligns with continuing the sequence. Since no specific preference regarding bite size is mentioned, we default to 5.0, consistent with previous bites.

Next food item: The next bite should be chicken to maintain the eating sequence of chicken followed by rice, and there's still a portion of chicken left to be consumed.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: No specific preference regarding bite size is indicated. Therefore, we default to a bite size of 5.0, which aligns with the default and the bite history.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has a preference for tilted spoonfuls during feeding, indicating they prefer a higher exit angle for the spoon when being fed.

Strategy: Given the user’s preference for tilted spoonfuls, the exit angle will be adjusted to reflect this preference. The bite history shows a consistent choice of a 100.0 exit angle for both chicken and rice, suggesting the user's comfort or preference with this angle. There is no stated preference towards the distance to the mouth, so it will remain at the default of 7.5.

Next distance to mouth: No specific preference for distance was mentioned; thus, the default value is retained.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: User preference indicates a tilt, and previous bites have consistently used a 100.0 exit angle, aligning with user’s preferred tilting. Therefore, sticking to this exit angle mirrors their preference.

One bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to first consume one bite of chicken, followed by two bites of rice in a repeating cycle until these items are finished.

Strategy: Since the preference outlines a specific order of consuming one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice, and considering the portions remaining for each item, the strategy is to follow this order as closely as possible. Given the bite history and items remaining, it is inferred that rice should be the next food item because the last food item consumed was chicken, and there are still portions of rice left.

Next food item: The last noted item eaten was chicken, and according to the preference pattern, rice should follow chicken. Since there is still rice available (1 portion left), rice is the correct choice to maintain the pattern of the user's preference.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed with a tilted spoon, which indicates a preference for a higher exit angle than a standard spoon position might provide.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference for "tilted spoonfuls," we'll focus on increasing the exit angle. The bite history shows a consistent exit angle of 100.0 degrees for both chicken and rice, suggesting satisfaction with this tilt level considering the preference. There's no specific mention of a preference for changing the distance to the mouth, so we'll keep it at the default unless specified otherwise.

Next distance to mouth: No specific preference indicated towards adjusting the distance to the mouth. Maintaining the default value of 7.5 as it aligns with the user's past bites.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: The preference for tilted spoonfuls suggests an inclination towards a higher tilt, and the historical exit angle of 100.0 has been consistent across bites. We'll continue with this value as it seems to meet the user's preference effectively.

I want one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice in that specific order.

Strategy: Based on the preference to alternate between chicken and rice in a specified sequence (1 bite of chicken, then 2 bites of rice), and considering that the portions remaining for chicken are 0, and for rice, there are 2 portions left, the choice should adhere to the user's preference as closely as possible while also respecting the availability of food items. Given that chicken is no longer available and the preference sequence cannot be continued as initially intended, we will move on to the next available item in the preference list, which is rice, that still has portions remaining.

Next food item: Since chicken has no remaining portions and cannot be chosen again, and based on the user's preference and availability, the next item should be rice, which still has portions remaining.

The user wants one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user wants a feeding cycle that gives one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice before it repeats. 

Strategy: Since there is a clear preference for the sequence of food items (chicken then rice), we follow this pattern. Based on the portions remaining, which is [0, 0, 2] for ['chicken', 'rice', 'peas'], both chicken and rice have been fully consumed, leaving only peas available for feeding. The preference order cannot be followed due to the unavailability of chicken and rice. Therefore, we will choose peas as the next food item to feed. Since no specific bite size preference was mentioned, we default to the default bite size of 5.0, aligning with the consistent previous bite sizes.

Next food item: Peas are the only option remaining with portions left, despite the preference for chicken followed by rice.
