Alternate between rice and vegetables but do not feed me chicken.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to alternate between rice and vegetables but explicitly avoids chicken. The preference indicates a sequence that should be followed, alternating between the rice and vegetables without any chicken, and no specific bite size preference has been stated.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for alternating between rice and vegetables, and with the items remaining being ['rice', 'spinach', 'broccoli'] all having equal portions remaining, we should follow a sequence that aligns with their preference. Since no previous food item has been fed (no bite history), we will start with rice to adhere to the alternation pattern. The bite size defaults to 5.0, as there's no specific indication for preferring smaller or larger bites.

Next food item: Since we're starting fresh without any previous bites and need to respect the user's preference for alternating between rice and vegetables (and avoiding chicken), the first choice logically falls to rice, as it is mentioned first and all items have equal portions remaining.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: With no specific preference indicated towards bite size and no previous bites to consider for adjusting the size based on feedback, we default to the median value of 5.0.

Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Keep the spoon far from my mouth.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to keep the spoon further from their mouth when taking a bite.
Strategy: Since the preference explicitly mentions keeping the spoon far from the mouth, the distance_to_mouth should be increased to the maximum allowable value to respect this preference. There's no explicit preference regarding the exit_angle, so it will remain at the default value.
Next distance to mouth: The preference indicates a desire for the spoon to be farther from the mouth, so the maximum value in the allowed range is chosen.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating between rice and vegetables while explicitly avoiding chicken. The next bite should follow this preference while considering portions remaining.

Strategy: Given the last bite was rice, and the preference is to alternate between rice and vegetables, the next item should be a vegetable. Both spinach and broccoli are available and have equal portions remaining. Since the preference does not specify a particular order between different vegetables, we can choose either. To ensure variety, we'll select spinach as the next food item.

Next food item: Since spinach is a vegetable, it aligns with the user's preference to alternate between rice and vegetables. Spinach also has portions remaining, satisfying the condition for choosing the next food item.
Next food item as string: 'spinach'
Next bite size: The last bite size was 5.0, and there's no specific preference stated for changing the bite size, so we will default to 5.0.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating between rice and vegetables, explicitly stating to avoid chicken. The priority is to alternate food items between categories (rice and vegetables) based on the listed preference, ensuring that chicken is never selected.

Strategy: Considering the preference for alternating between rice and vegetables, and given the previous bites included rice and then spinach, the next logical choice, according to the user's alternating preference, would be back to rice since it's the only other category (grain) available and it aligns with the alternating pattern. Since broccoli is also available, which is a vegetable, it’s important to keep alternating, but since rice was fed first and then a vegetable (spinach), rice comes next to maintain the pattern. The portions remaining for each item (rice, spinach, and broccoli) are 2, which means all items are still available for selection. Since there's no specific preference indicated for bite size, and the last bite size was 5.0, we'll default to this value again.

Next food item: Given the preference to alternate between rice and vegetables, and with the last consumed item being a vegetable (spinach), we choose 'rice' because it's the next in the sequence to maintain the alternation. There's still a portion of rice remaining, making it a valid choice. 

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: Since the preference does not specify a deviation from the default bite size and considering consistency with previous bites, we continue with the default value of 5.0.

Summary: The user prefers keeping the spoon far from their mouth.
Strategy: Since the user has a specific preference for keeping the spoon far from their mouth and the bite history shows consistent application of this preference, I will adhere to these specifics. The exit angle has no preference indicated, so it will stay at the default unless guided by the user's preference.
Next distance to mouth: Given the user's preference for keeping the spoon far and previous bites all being at the farthest distance, I will maintain this distance.

Alternate between rice and vegetables, but do not feed me chicken.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating between rice and vegetables, specifically avoiding chicken. The pattern suggests a preference for variety with a specific exclusion.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for alternating between rice and vegetables, and considering the last bite was rice, the next logical choice would follow the pattern, leading to a vegetable option. Since spinach and broccoli are the remaining vegetable options and spinach was the last vegetable fed, broccoli becomes the next choice to maintain variety and adhere to the alternation preference. The portions remaining for each item are rice (1), spinach (2), and broccoli (2), validating that broccoli still has portions available for feeding.

Next food item: The choice of 'broccoli' adheres to the preference for alternation between rice and vegetables, taking into account the need to vary the vegetables being fed and the last vegetable fed was spinach.

Next food item as string: 'broccoli'

Next bite size: Given no specific preference for smaller or larger bites in the preference, and considering the default and historical bite size has been 5.0 consistently, maintaining this size aligns with user familiarity and lacks indicative need for adjustment.

Alternate between rice and vegetables, but do not feed me chicken.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating between rice and vegetables, specifically without being fed chicken. The preference emphasizes a rotation between types of food rather than consuming all of one category before moving to another, and no adjustments to bite size are indicated.

Strategy: Given the user's preference to alternate between rice and vegetables, the next food item should follow this pattern. The last item fed was a vegetable (broccoli), hence the next should be rice, in line with the alternating pattern. Rice has portions remaining, making it a valid choice. Bite size will remain the default 5.0 as there's no preference indicating a change is needed.

Next food item: Since 'rice' was fed two bites ago and the last food was 'broccoli' (a vegetable), and considering the preference for alternation without chicken, 'rice' is the next logical choice based on both preference and the pattern observed. 'Rice' also has remaining portions.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Alternate between rice and vegetables, but do not feed me chicken.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to alternate between rice and vegetables while avoiding chicken entirely. This preference implies a sequence where the user is fed rice followed by any available vegetable before returning to rice, repeating this cycle without including chicken at any point.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference and the bite history, the last item eaten was rice, so the next item should be a vegetable. Both spinach and broccoli are available and have the same remaining portions and efficiency. Given that alternation between rice and vegetables is preferred, and given that both vegetables have equal priority due to similar portions and efficiency, either can be chosen. To maintain variety, since spinach was eaten before broccoli in the most recent cycle of vegetables, broccoli will be chosen next.

Next food item: Since rice was the last food item and the user prefers alternating between rice and vegetables, the next choice should be a vegetable. 'Broccoli' is chosen to alternate after the last vegetable, 'spinach', ensuring variety.

Next food item as string: 'broccoli'

Next bite size: The preference does not specify a change in bite size; therefore, the default of 5.0, which has been consistent in the bite history, will be used.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating between rice and vegetables, explicitly requesting to avoid chicken. This indicates a pattern where after a serving of rice, the next preference should be a vegetable, cycling back to rice afterward, if available.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference to alternate between rice and vegetables and to avoid chicken entirely, and taking into account the portions remaining for each food item, the strategy involves selecting the next food item that adheres to this alternation pattern. Given the bite history's last item was broccoli (a vegetable), the next logical choice, according to preference and availability, would be rice, assuming it adheres to the alternating pattern and rice portions are still available. Since the portions remaining indicate that there is still 1 portion of rice, 2 of spinach, and 1 of broccoli, rice is the appropriate choice. Bite size adjustments will default to 5.0 as there's no indication the user wants a different size.

Next food item: Since the last consumed item was broccoli, and the user prefers to alternate between rice and vegetables without consuming chicken, rice is chosen to maintain the alternation pattern. As per 'Items remaining' and 'Portions remaining', rice is still available with 1 portion left, making it the correct choice according to both preference and availability.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The user did not specify a preference for changing the bite size, so we will default to the standard bite size of 5.0, consistent with previous selections.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to alternate between rice and vegetables, explicitly mentioning not to feed them chicken. This implies a cyclical feeding pattern that should alternate between rice and a vegetable (spinach or broccoli), and completely avoid chicken.

Strategy: Since the preference is to alternate between rice and vegetables and the last item fed was rice, the next item should be a vegetable based on the remaining portions and user preference. Among the vegetables, spinach has more portions remaining than broccoli, fulfilling the cyclical pattern preference.

Given the portions remaining are as follows: Rice - 0, Spinach - 2, Broccoli - 1, the decision should prioritize spinach as it aligns with the alternating pattern of feeding and has sufficient portions left.

As for bite size, no specific preference is stated regarding altering the size from the standard 5.0. Thus, the default value of 5.0 will be maintained.

Next food item: Since the last item fed was rice and the user prefers to alternate between rice and vegetables with spinach having more portions remaining, spinach is chosen to maintain the alternation pattern and preference fulfillment.

Next food item as string: 'spinach'

Next bite size: No preference has been stated to change the bite size from the default; thus, it remains 5.0 to maintain consistency with previous feeds.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference indicates alternating between rice and vegetables, specifically without including chicken in the feeding sequence. The preference suggests an equal priority between rice and vegetables, aiming to alternate them in the meal plan.

Strategy: Since the preference is to alternate between rice and vegetables without feeding chicken, and considering the 'Portions remaining' which shows rice has been fully consumed ([0, 1, 1] corresponding to ['rice', 'spinach', 'broccoli']), the next item should be a vegetable. Given the last vegetable fed was spinach, and to maintain the alternation between different vegetables as well, the next logical choice, following the user's pattern and portions remaining, is 'broccoli', as it still has portions remaining. Since there is no specific preference for bite size alteration, we will maintain the default size.

Next food item: Given the preference to alternate and the portions remaining, the next choice should be 'broccoli'. This also follows the pattern of alternation observed in the bite history and adheres to the user's preferences and the current portions available.
