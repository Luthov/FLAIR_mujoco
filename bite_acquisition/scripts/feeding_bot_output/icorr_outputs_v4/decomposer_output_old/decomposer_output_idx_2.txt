=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
I only want meat with larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to eat meat with larger bite sizes compared to other food types.

Strategy: Prioritizing the user's preference for meat with larger bite sizes. Since 'beef' is the only meat option available and the user prefers larger bites for meat, we choose 'beef' as the next food item. Given no specific bite size is mentioned within the preference beyond "larger bites" for meat, we will select a bite size larger than the default but not at the maximum to accommodate the preference without specific guidance on the exact size. Choosing a 7.0 as it is larger than the default but allows for adjustment based on future feedback.

Next food item: 'beef' is chosen as it aligns with the user's preference for meat and there are portions remaining.
Next food item as string: 'beef'
Next bite size: Given the preference for larger bites for meat, a bite size larger than the default is selected, but not the largest to balance out the user's preference and the lack of a specific size request.
Next bite size as float: 7.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Tilt the spoon slightly when feeding me.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be tilted slightly when being fed.
Strategy: Since there's a preference for a slight tilt, this inclination should be considered while keeping the default distance unless specified otherwise.
Next distance to mouth: No specific preference was mentioned for changing the distance from the default of 7.5.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: The user's preference to tilt the spoon slightly indicates adjusting the exit angle from the default. Considering "slightly," a slight adjustment seems appropriate, moving from the default towards a higher tilt but not excessively so.
Next exit angle as float: 95.0
=== PARAMETERS ===
NEXT BITE: beef
BITE SIZE: 7.0
DISTANCE TO MOUTH: 7.5
EXIT ANGLE: 95.0

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
I only want meat. Feed me with larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed only meat with larger bite sizes than average.

Strategy: Given the preference for meat and the request for larger bites, the selection process is simple. Since beef is the only meat option available and there's a preference for larger bites, the next food choice is clear. The previous bite size for beef was 7.0, which aligns well with the user's request for larger bites. Considering there’s still beef left to be consumed, it's logical to continue with beef. The portions remaining for each item are as follows: beef (2), potatoes (2), salad (2), showing that all items still have portions left, but preference dictates selecting beef until it's finished.

Next food item: Since beef is the specified preference for meat and there are portions of it remaining (2 portions left), it is chosen as the next food item to maintain alignment with the user's explicit preference for meat only.

Next food item as string: 'beef'

Next bite size: The user's preference for "larger bites" directs choosing a bite size larger than the default. Given that the last bite size recorded was 7.0 and this falls into the category of larger bites as per the user’s liking, maintaining the same size will continue to fulfill the user's preference for larger bites, suggesting a continuation of what has been previously satisfying.

Next bite size as float: 7.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Tilt the spoon slightly when feeding me.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers that the spoon is tilted slightly when feeding them.
Strategy: Based on the user's preference for a slight tilt, and considering the previous bite settings, we will adjust the exit angle to increase the tilt slightly but keep the distance the same as there is no explicit preference mentioned for changing it.
Next distance to mouth: No preference indicated to changes in distance, so we'll maintain the previous value.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: User's preference suggests a slight increase in tilt from the default or last used value. Last exit angle was set to 95.0; increasing it slightly.
Next exit angle as float: 97.0
=== PARAMETERS ===
NEXT BITE: beef
BITE SIZE: 7.0

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
The user only wants meat and prefers larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers only meat with a preference for larger bites.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for meat and larger bites, and considering the items and portions remaining ['beef', 'potatoes', 'salad'] with corresponding portions [1, 2, 2], the next food item should continue to be meat since that aligns with the user’s specific preference. The bite history indicates a preference for bites larger than the default size, with recent bites being 7.0.

Next food item: Since 'beef' is the only meat option remaining and aligns with the user's preference, and there is still 1 portion of it left, it should be the next item chosen to comply with the preference for meat. Other items, 'potatoes' and 'salad', do not align with the user's specified desire for meat.

Next food item as string: 'beef'

Next bite size: The preference for larger bites is clear, and the bite history supports choosing a size larger than the default, with previous sizes being 7.0. To align with the user's preference and historical bite sizes, the same size will be chosen again.

Next bite size as float: 7.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
The spoon should be tilted slightly when feeding the user.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be tilted slightly when feeding.
Strategy: Given the preference for a slight tilt and the increasing exit angles in the bite history, the next exit angle should be slightly higher than the last to match the user’s preference. Since there is no explicit preference for changing the distance to the mouth, it remains unchanged.
Next distance to mouth: There is no indicated preference for changing the distance, so it remains at the default value.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: Since the previous exit angles were 95.0 and 97.0, and there's a preference for slight tilt, the exit angle will be increased slightly to continue matching the preference.
Next exit angle as float: 99.0

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Only want meat, with larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to only eat meat with larger bites.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference for only wanting meat and preferring larger bites, the decision for the next food item should prioritize meat options available in the remaining food items list. Since 'beef' is the only meat option listed and there is at least one portion remaining of it, it will be chosen as the next food item. For bite size, considering the user's preference for larger bites and previous bite sizes recorded in the bite history, a value larger than the default but consistent with past preferences will be selected.

Next food item: 'beef' is chosen because it is the only meat option available, aligns with the user's preference, and there is at least one portion remaining. The current portions remaining for the items are 1 for 'beef', 2 for 'potatoes', and 2 for 'salad'. 

Next food item as string: 'beef'

Next bite size: Considering the preference for larger bites and the history indicating previous bites were sized 7.0, the next bite size should match this preference while not exceeding the maximum allowed, maintaining a larger bite size consistent with past choices.

Next bite size as float: 7.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Tilt the spoon slightly when feeding.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be slightly tilted when being fed.
Strategy: Incrementally increase the exit angle to enhance the tilt as per preference, observing the progressive increase in exit angle in the bite history.
Next distance to mouth: No preference stated for distance, so it remains unchanged at the default which aligns with the historical values.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: Since the last exit angle used was 99.0 degrees, and there is a preference for a slight tilt, increasing the angle slightly beyond the last used value should meet the preference.
Next exit angle as float: 101.0

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Only wants meat and larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to eat meat with a preference for larger bites, indicating they do not want vegetables or smaller bites.

Strategy: Since the preference is to only eat meat and prefer larger bites, we will disregard both potatoes and salad as they do not align with the meat preference. Even though all the remaining portions of beef have been consumed (as indicated by a portion count of 0), the user’s preference strictly requests meat, which leaves us unable to fulfill the request based on the given items and portions remaining. However, to follow the instructions strictly, and since providing a next food item even if it does not align with the preferences when all preferred options are exhausted is not specified, we will not suggest an available non-preferred food item. For bite size, since the user prefers larger bites and the bite history consistently shows a size of 7.0, we will continue with this size to align with the preference.

Next food item: Given the user's preference for only meat and considering all meat portions (beef) have been consumed (portions remaining at 0 for beef, and 2 each for potatoes and salad), there's no meat option left to choose from based on the current inventory. Therefore, we cannot choose a next food item that aligns with the user's preferences of only wanting meat. However, instructions require suggesting a food item with remaining portions, thus ignoring the preference due to the limitations in the available options.

Next food item as string: ''

Next bite size: Considering the preference for larger bites and previous bite sizes of 7.0, we maintain this size to fulfill the preference for larger bites.

Next bite size as float: 7.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Tilt the spoon slightly when feeding.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have the spoon tilted slightly when feeding.
Strategy: Since the user prefers the spoon to be tilted slightly, we observe an increasing tilt preference in the history of bites from 95.0 to 101.0 degrees. Based on the progression and the user's preference for a slight tilt, we aim to continue in this direction but with a cautious increment to ensure comfort and practicality.
Next distance to mouth: There's no specific preference indicating a need to adjust the distance to the mouth; thus, we will keep it at the default value of 7.5.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: The exit angle has been progressively increasing with each bite. Given the preference for a slight tilt and the observed trend, we will continue this pattern and adjust slightly above the last angle to 103.0, considering it still falls within the safe range of allowed values and adheres to the user's preference for tilt.
Next exit angle as float: 103.0
