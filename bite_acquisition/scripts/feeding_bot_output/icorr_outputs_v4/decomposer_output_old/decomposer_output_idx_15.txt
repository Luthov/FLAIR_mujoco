=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Give me larger bites of chicken, followed by smaller bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have larger bites of chicken first, and then proceed with smaller bites of rice. There's no mention of peas in the preference, suggesting it is a lower priority compared to chicken and rice.

Strategy: Since chicken is the first preference and there's a request for larger bites, we will select chicken as the next food item. Given that we are starting with chicken and there's no specific bite size mentioned other than "larger," we’ll interpret larger as being significantly above the default of 5.0, but not at the maximum to allow for adjustment based on the user's feedback. As peas are not mentioned in the preference, they will be the last priority after chicken and rice are finished.

Next food item: Chicken is the first in the user’s preference list and there are portions remaining for it. 

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: The user prefers larger bites for chicken, so choosing a value above the default 5.0 is justified. Given no other guidance, a value of 7.5 strikes a balance between "larger" and the maximum value.

Next bite size as float: 7.5
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Feed me with a tilt in the spoon and do not come too close to me.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers not to have the spoon come too close and likes a tilt in the spoon during feeding.

Strategy: Given the user's desire for a tilt and to keep the spoon further away, the parameters were adjusted accordingly.

Next distance to mouth: Given the preference against coming too close, the distance is set to be further than the default.
Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5

Next exit angle: The preference for a tilt suggests an adjustment to a higher angle than the default.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Larger bites of chicken, followed by smaller bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers larger bites of chicken before consuming smaller bites of rice. There's no specific mention of peas, implying it could be consumed last without a specified bite size preference.

Strategy: Given the preference for larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice, and considering the portions remaining, the next food item should continue to be chicken to honor the preference sequence. The bite history suggests a previous bite size of 7.5 for chicken, aligning with the preference for larger bites. Since chicken still has portions remaining and adhering to the user's preference is paramount, the next bite will also be chicken but should consider maintaining or slightly adjusting the large bite size to ensure satisfaction.

Next food item: Since chicken is preferred first and portions of chicken still remain (2 portions remaining for chicken, along with 2 for rice and 2 for peas), it's logical to continue with chicken to respect the user's preference hierarchy and the principle of completing one food item before moving to the next.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: Given the preference for larger bites of chicken and taking into account the previous bite size was 7.5, a similar or slightly adjusted size could ensure consistency with the user's preference. Thus, staying with a similar size respects the user's liking for larger bites without exceeding what they've previously been comfortable with.

Next bite size as float: 7.5
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Feed with a tilt in the spoon and maintain some distance.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed with a noticeable tilt in the spoon and wishes to maintain a moderate distance from the spoon to their mouth.

Strategy: The last bite taken with chicken was served at a distance of 8.5 and an exit angle of 100.0. This suggests that both the slightly further distance and the higher tilt were acceptable or preferable, aligning with the user's general preference for a tilt in the spoon and some distance.

Next distance to mouth: Since the user's preference mentions maintaining some distance and the previous successful delivery was at 8.5, which is above the default but within the user's comfort range, we will maintain this distance to provide consistency with the last positive experience.

Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5

Next exit angle: The user's preference for a tilt in the spoon was addressed in the last delivery with an exit angle of 100.0 degrees, suggesting a higher tilt than the default. This was successfully implemented, and given the preference for tilt, it should be maintained to ensure the user's comfort and satisfaction.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers larger bites of chicken before moving onto smaller bites of rice. Peas have not been mentioned, so their priority could be considered last or based on remaining portions after chicken and rice are finished.

Strategy: Given the user's preference, the next food item should be chicken, as it is preferred to be consumed first and in larger bites. Since there is still a portion of chicken remaining, it aligns with the priority of feeding chicken before rice. Considering the bite history shows previous bites of chicken were sized at 7.5, and with the user specifying a preference for larger bites for chicken, continuing with a similar bite size adheres to this preference. 

Next food item: Since there is still chicken remaining (1 portion remaining out of initial), and based on the preference of consuming all of chicken before moving onto rice, chicken should be the next food item to stay consistent with the user's request and considering the previous sequences of feeding.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: Previous bites of chicken have been large (7.5), aligning with the user’s preference for larger bites of chicken. As the preference specifically mentions larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice and there is no change indicated in preference, maintaining the same bite size as previous (7.5) is appropriate to ensure consistency with the user's preference.

Next bite size as float: 7.5
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Feed with a tilt in the spoon and maintain a distance.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers feeding with a tilt in the spoon and wants to maintain a certain distance from the mouth.

Strategy: Given the preference for a tilt and the history of using an exit angle of 100.0 consistently for chicken, the exit angle should be adjusted accordingly to match this preference. The preference to maintain a distance does not specify closer or further explicitly, but since the history shows a consistent distance of 8.5, which is above the default, we will use this historical preference as a cue for maintaining distance.

Next distance to mouth: The last two bites were given at a distance of 8.5, which suggests that this distance is preferred by the user. The instruction to maintain distance, combined with this history, leads to the decision to keep the distance to mouth at 8.5, as it aligns with past successful feedings.

Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5

Next exit angle: The preference mentions a tilt, which aligns with the historical exit angles of 100.0 for feeding chicken. Since the user already experienced this angle positively twice, and there's a preference for a tilt, it's logical to continue with the same exit angle to meet the user's needs effectively.

Larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice, indicating a sequence in which food should be served as well as preferences in bite sizes for each type of food.

Strategy: Given that the user's preference states larger bites of chicken should be served before smaller bites of rice, and considering the Portions remaining, we should continue to serve chicken until it's fully consumed. The bite history shows that previous bites of chicken were 7.5, which is considered a larger bite size in line with the user's preference for chicken.

Next food item: Since there is still a portion of chicken remaining (1 portion) and it aligns with the user's preference to finish chicken before moving on to rice, the next food item should be chicken.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: The user's preference for larger bites of chicken and the historical bite sizes being 7.5 suggest that the user is satisfied with this bite size for chicken. Therefore, we'll maintain this bite size for consistency with their preference.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Feed with a tilt in the spoon and maintain some distance when approaching.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers using a tilt in the spoon and maintaining some distance when approaching for feeding. 

Strategy: Given the preference for a tilt and maintaining some distance, along with the consistent previous bites having a distance of 8.5 and an exit angle of 100.0, we will continue these parameters to match the user’s preference effectively.

Next distance to mouth: The preference and historical data suggest maintaining a similar distance; thus, we keep the distance to mouth as previously successful, aligning with user comfort and preference.
Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5

Next exit angle: The preference indicates a tilt but not how much higher or lower it should be from the standard; however, the historical data shows a preference for a 100.0 angle, which we'll continue to use for consistency and adherence to implied preference.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Give me larger bites of chicken, followed by smaller bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have larger bites of chicken first, followed by smaller bites of rice.

Strategy: Since all of the chicken has been consumed (as inferred from the preference and bite history showing only chicken has been consumed, and there's a preference for chicken first which suggests moving to rice next), the next logical choice based on the user's stated preference is to move to rice. The preference explicitly mentions smaller bites for rice, suggesting we adjust the bite size from the previous larger bites of chicken to smaller ones.

Next food item: Given the preference for larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice, and considering chicken has already been consumed in large bites, the next item should be rice, especially as it still has portions remaining.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The user prefers smaller bites for rice. Since the previous larger bite sizes for chicken were around 7.5, significantly reducing the bite size aligns with the "smaller bites" preference. Given no exact size was specified, choosing a size significantly smaller than 7.5 but not the smallest possible, defaulting slightly below the default (5.0) seems reasonable. Thus, opting for a bit smaller to reflect the preference for "smaller bites" of rice.

Next bite size as float: 3.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Feed me with a tilt in the spoon and do not come too close to me.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to not be too close during feeding and desires a tilt in the spoon.
Strategy: Given the user’s preference for not being too close, it's sensible to choose a distance greater than the default. Considering the consistent previous distance was 8.5, and no closer preference was indicated, it's appropriate to maintain this value. For the exit angle, the preference towards a tilt indicates a need for an angle different from the default, likely higher, to accommodate the tilt preference.
Next distance to mouth: The preference indicates not too close, and the history shows a consistent use of 8.5, which aligns with this preference.
Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5
Next exit angle: The preference for a tilt suggests a higher angle than the default; however, the previous history shows a preference for 100.0, which might already reflect the desired tilt.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference indicates they want larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice. This suggests a priority of consuming all chicken in larger bite amounts before moving on to rice in smaller bite sizes.

Strategy: Since all the chicken has been consumed (based on previously supplied bite history and matching portion counts), the next item according to the user's preference and portions remaining should be rice. Peas are not mentioned in the preference and thus are considered last. The preference for rice is for smaller bites than the chicken bites, and the history shows a previous rice bite size of 3.0, which aligns with the "smaller bites" directive.

Next food item: The next food item should be 'rice', as 'chicken' is all consumed and the preference specifies rice to be eaten in smaller bites after chicken.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: Since the preference indicates smaller bites for rice and the last bite of rice was 3.0, maintaining this size aligns with both the user's preference and consistency with prior feeding.

Next bite size as float: 3.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Feed with a tilted spoon and maintain some distance from the user.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed with a tilted spoon while maintaining some distance.

Strategy: Based on the preference for a tilted spoon and maintaining distance with past parameters consistently set for certain foods, we'll adjust the parameters within the user's comfortable range. The history shows a trend towards an 8.5 distance to mouth and a 100.0 exit angle for both chicken and rice, indicating a specific preference for how food is served.

Next distance to mouth: Since the preference indicates maintaining some distance and the history consistently shows a distance of 8.5, it suggests this distance likely aligns with the user's comfort. Therefore, we'll choose this distance again.
Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5

Next exit angle: The preference for a tilted spoon is evident, and given that previous servings, including rice, were at a 100.0 exit angle, this seems to align well with the user's preference for tilt. We'll use this angle again.

Give larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice. There is no preference mentioned for peas, suggesting they should be fed last or according to the default bite size if there is no specific guidance.

Strategy: Since the chicken has already been fully consumed (0 portions remaining), the next priority, according to the user's preference, is rice, for which smaller bites are preferred. Peas haven't been mentioned in the preference, suggesting they are the least priority and will be fed after rice according to default settings or any available preferences. The current portions remaining are: chicken (0), rice (1), peas (2). The last food item fed was rice, with a bite size of 3.0, indicating the preference for smaller bites for rice.

Next food item: Given the user's preference and the availability of portions, the next food item to be fed should be rice, as it is the only food item mentioned in the preference that still has portions remaining.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The user has specified a preference for smaller bites for rice. According to the bite history, the previous bites for rice have been 3.0, which aligns with this preference. To continue adhering to this preference, the next bite size should also be kept smaller.

Next bite size as float: 3.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Feed with a tilt in the spoon and maintain some distance.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed with the spoon tilted and at a certain distance from the mouth, rather than too close.
Strategy: Based on the provided preferences and previous bite history, the approach involves selecting values that maintain a balance between spoon distance and tilt while also accommodating the nature of the food (in this case, rice) which might require specific handling to ensure a comfortable bite.
Next distance to mouth: Given the preference for maintaining some distance, along with the consistent history of using 8.5 as the distance, it's logical to continue with this value rather than adjust to the default or choose an extremity.
Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5
Next exit angle: The preference mentions a tilt in the spoon, and the history shows the use of a 100.0 angle for both chicken and rice. This suggests that the user finds a 100.0 exit angle comfortable for different types of food, indicating it's a preferred tilt that should be continued.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Alternate larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating between larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice. These preferences suggest variable bite sizes for different food items, instead of a uniform size across the board.

Strategy: Given the preference for alternating between larger bites of chicken and smaller bites of rice, along with the current portions remaining ({'chicken': 0, 'rice': 1, 'peas': 2}), the next food item should be rice since chicken is fully consumed and we should follow the preference as closely as possible. Since the preference is for smaller bites of rice after larger bites of chicken, and the last recorded bites of rice were of size 3.0, we will continue with this size to maintain consistency with the user's preference.

Next food item: Since chicken has no remaining portions and rice does, and considering the user's preference, rice is the chosen next food item. It's important to alternate according to preference and the portions available.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The bite history shows smaller bites of rice at 3.0, adhering to the user's preference for smaller bites of rice following larger bites of chicken. Since we aim to maintain this preference, the next bite size should also be a smaller bite of 3.0.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers feeding with a tilt in the spoon and maintains some distance during feeding.
Strategy: Since the preference involves both maintaining distance and using a tilt, we will consider the previous parameters set for rice which showed a pattern, and align the adjustments accordingly keeping in mind the requested preference for a tilted spoon and a certain distance.
Next distance to mouth: The previous parameters for feeding rice indicate a preference for keeping the spoon at 8.5, which is a bit further than the default but maintains some distance as per the user's preference. We will stick with this value.
Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5
Next exit angle: Given the preference for a tilt and the consistent use of an exit angle of 100.0 degrees for both chicken and rice in the history, it indicates that this angle works well for the user, balancing the need for tilt without being too steep or too shallow.

Summary: The user prefers larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice. As per their preference, they would like to consume all portions of chicken with larger bite sizes before moving on to rice with smaller bite sizes.

Strategy: Since all portions of chicken and rice have been consumed, and peas are the only remaining food item, peas will be selected as the next food item. The bite size preference only specifies sizes for chicken and rice, so we default to the bite size of 5.0 for peas as no specific preference is mentioned for it.

Next food item: 'peas' have portions remaining and are the only option left to feed, following the preference rule and portions available.

Give larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice. Given that both chicken and rice have been fully consumed based on the provided portions remaining, the only preference applicable now pertains to the bite size for any remaining food items.

Strategy: Since both chicken and rice portions are fully consumed (0 portions remaining for these items), and since peas are the only remaining food item with portions left (2 portions remaining), peas will be the next food item to feed. The preference for bite size was larger for chicken and smaller for rice. Since peas are the only food left and there was no specific preference mentioned for them, we will default to the most recent bite size of peas from the bite history as a guide, which was 5.0.

Next food item: Peas are the only remaining food with portions left, so peas will be chosen as the next food item in the absence of availability of preferred items (chicken and rice).

Next food item as string: 'peas'

Next bite size: No specific preference for peas bite size was mentioned; hence, we default to the last known bite size for peas, which was 5.0, as indicated in the bite history.
