=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Alternate bites of chicken and rice are preferred, with a preference for larger bite sizes.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternative bites of chicken and rice, with a leaning towards larger bite sizes. There is no mention of peas in the priority, suggesting they should be consumed last or less frequently.

Strategy: Since alternate bites of chicken and rice are preferred and there's a preference for larger bites, the first step is to choose between chicken and rice without consideration for peas at this moment. Given that there's no bite history to suggest which was chosen last, and both have equal portions remaining, we'll select chicken to start the preferred sequence. For bite size, the preference indicates a liking for larger bite sizes. Though the default is 5.0, since 'larger bite sizes' are preferred, we will select a value above 5.0 but not at the maximum to allow adjustment based on user satisfaction.

Next food item: Since there's no bite history to indicate a previous choice and both preferred items (chicken and rice) have equal portions remaining, starting with chicken adheres to the alternating preference and initiates the sequence.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
Next bite size: Given the preference for larger bite sizes, and without previous bite sizes to adjust from, a value above the default and leaning towards the larger end will likely satisfy the userâ€™s preference without immediately maxing out, leaving room for further increase if desired.
Next bite size as float: 7.5
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
The spoon should be further away during feeding.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be further away during feeding.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for a more distant spoon placement, we will adjust the distance_to_mouth parameter to a value greater than the default 7.5, while keeping the exit_angle at the default 90.0 due to no specific preference mentioned for it.

Next distance to mouth: The user has a preference for the spoon to be further away, so we will increase the distance from the default.
Next distance to mouth as float: 10.0

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Alternate bites of chicken and rice. Prefer larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to alternate between bites of chicken and rice, favoring larger bites when possible.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference for alternating bites of chicken and rice and preferring larger bites, and considering the bite history that shows a previous bite of chicken with a size of 7.5, the next food item should be rice to maintain the alternation. Since 'peas' are also available but not mentioned in the preference, they will be ignored in favor of prioritizing the user's preference for chicken and rice. The portions remaining for each item are: chicken (2), rice (2), peas (2), indicating all items still have portions left. The last food item taken was chicken, so next should be rice to alternate as per preference. For bite size, given the user's preference for larger bites and a previous bite size of 7.5, we will maintain a larger bite size within the given range.

Next food item: 'rice' is chosen as the next food item as it follows the user's preference to alternate between chicken and rice, and it's the next in sequence after the last consumed item was chicken.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: Since the user prefers larger bites and the previous bite (of chicken) was 7.5, the next bite of rice will also be set to a larger value to continue respecting the user's preference for larger bites.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be further away during feeding.
Strategy: Given the user's preference for the spoon to be further away, the last bite distance to the mouth will be adapted, while the exit angle will default to 90.0 as there's no expressed preference towards the tilt.
Next distance to mouth: The preference is for the spoon to be further away, and the last bite was at 10.0, which aligns with this preference. Thus, maintaining the distance for rice.
Next distance to mouth as float: 10.0

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Alternate bites of chicken and rice; prefers larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to alternate bites of chicken and rice, indicating a desire for variety. They also prefer larger bites, meaning they favor bite sizes above the default.

Strategy: Given the user's preference to alternate between chicken and rice and their inclination towards larger bites, the strategy involves following the alternation pattern closely and selecting bite sizes that are larger than the default. Considering the bite history, which shows a latest bite of rice, the next food item should be chicken to maintain the alternation. Since 'peas' haven't been mentioned in the preference, they will be considered less of a priority unless both chicken and rice portions are finished or not available. The bite size previously used for both chicken and rice was 7.5, which aligns with the user's preference for larger bites. Therefore, there's a clear inclination to continue with a similar size for the next bite to satisfy the user's preference.

Next food item: The last recorded bite was of 'rice', and the user prefers to alternate between chicken and rice. Given this preference and the fact that there's an equal number of portions remaining for both (2 each for chicken, rice, and peas), the next choice should be chicken to follow the alternation pattern.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: Since the user prefers larger bites and the previous bites of both chicken and rice were 7.5, it's reasonable to continue with this size to meet the user's preference for larger bites.

Next bite size as float: 7.5
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Prefers the spoon to be further away.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be further away when taking a bite. There is no stated preference for the tilt of the spoon (exit angle).

Strategy: I will select the distance to mouth based on the user's preference for it to be further away, and the bite history showing a consistent choice of 10.0, which is the furthest option. Since there's no preference stated for the exit angle, I will maintain the default value of 90.0, which also aligns with the bite history.

Next distance to mouth: The user's preference and the bite history both indicate a preference for the spoon to be further away, suggesting that the distance to mouth should be at the further end of the scale.
Next distance to mouth as float: 10.0
Next exit angle: There's no stated preference for the exit angle, and the bite history shows a consistent choice of 90.0, so I will keep it at the default.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and rice with larger bite sizes.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and rice, specifically with larger bite sizes than the default.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference for larger bite sizes and alternating bites of chicken and rice, and based on the portions remaining ('Items remaining': ['chicken', 'rice', 'peas'] with corresponding portions [1, 2, 2]), the next food item should continue to adhere to this alternating pattern. Given the bite history has most recently included 'chicken', and following the stated preference for alternation, the next bite should be of 'rice'. The portions remaining indicate that both chicken and rice are still available, supporting this selection. Since the user prefers larger bites, and previous bite sizes were 7.5, we should continue with this size to satisfy the user's preference.

Next food item: As 'chicken' was the most recent food item fed and considering the user's preference for alternating between chicken and rice, along with their inclination towards larger bites, 'rice' should be the next item selected. 'Peas' are not part of the preferred alternating sequence.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: Considering the user's preference for larger bite sizes, as evidenced by the past bites of 7.5, and the absence of any new instructions to change this, the bite size will remain consistent at 7.5.

Alternate bites of chicken and rice with larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternate bites of chicken and rice with larger bites, suggesting a pattern of consumption and a preference for bigger portion sizes per bite.

Strategy: Given the preference for alternating between chicken and rice with larger bite sizes and considering the portions remaining for each item, the next item should follow the pattern while ensuring there is still a portion left for both chicken and rice. Since peas are not part of the specified preference, they will be prioritized last, unless the other items have been fully consumed. The bite history shows a trend of selecting bites of size 7.5, indicating a preference for larger than the default size bites.

Next food item: Following the alternation preference and the last item consumed being rice, the next logical choice, based on available portions and the alternating pattern, is chicken. Portions remaining are: Chicken (1), Rice (1), Peas (2).

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: Continuing with the user's larger bite preference, as evidenced by the historical bite sizes of 7.5, the next bite size should match this to maintain consistency with the user's preference.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to alternate between bites of chicken and rice, leaning towards larger bites for each serving.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference for alternating bites between chicken and rice and preferring larger bites, the next food item should follow the pattern observed in the bite history. Given that the last item consumed was chicken, and considering the user's preference, the next item should be rice to maintain the alternation pattern. The portions remaining indicate that both chicken and rice have 1 portion left, which aligns with the user's preference for alternation. Since the preference also indicates a favor for larger bite sizes and the historical bite sizes have consistently been 7.5, this value should be maintained to respect the user's preference for larger bites.

Next food item: Since the last consumed item was chicken, to alternate according to the user's preference, the next item should be rice. The portions remaining for chicken and rice are both 1, which aligns with continuing the alternation pattern.

Next food item as string: 'rice'
