Only vegetables in small bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to eat only vegetables and desires for those vegetable servings to be in small bites.

Strategy: Given the user's preference, the next food item should be a vegetable and the bite size should be smaller than the default. Among the items remaining ['beef', 'potatoes', 'cabbage'], the 'cabbage' is the only vegetable. Since 'cabbage' also corresponds to the user's preference for smaller bites, the bite size will be adjusted to the smaller end of the scale, respecting the user's specified preference. Current portions remaining are 2 for all items, which indicates that all items are still available for consumption. Given that preferences prioritize vegetables, and within available options, 'cabbage' fits the criteria, it will be the next food item. The bite size will be adjusted to the smaller side as indicated by the preference for "small bites", thus selecting a value lower than the default.

Next food item: 'cabbage' is selected because it is the only vegetable from the remaining items list and matches the user's preference for vegetables.

Next food item as string: 'cabbage'

Next bite size: The preference for "small bites" suggests selecting a value smaller than the default. Considering the scale from 1.0 to 10.0, a value significantly below 5.0 would suit the user's preference for smaller bites.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to receive only vegetables in small bites, implying larger bites are acceptable for non-vegetables.

Strategy: Given the preference for smaller bites for vegetables and considering the remaining portions of ['beef', 'potatoes', 'cabbage'] with corresponding portions [2, 2, 2], as well as efficiency [1, 1, 1] without any specific ordering, the strategy is to prioritize feeding a vegetable in a small bite next, as per the user's preference. Since 'cabbage' is a vegetable and was previously served in a small bite (2.0), it aligns with the user's preference for smaller bites for vegetables and still has portions remaining.

Next food item: 'cabbage' is the next choice because it is a vegetable that fits the preference for small bites and it still has portions remaining. 

Next food item as string: 'cabbage'

Next bite size: Since 'cabbage' was previously served in a small bite, and the preference is to serve vegetables in small bites, the bite size should remain small to accommodate the user's preference for vegetable servings. A previous bite size of 2.0 for cabbage aligns well with this preference.

Summary: The user has no expressed preference based on the information provided. The only historical data available is a single spoonful of cabbage served with parameters set to defaults (7.5 for distance_to_mouth and 90.0 for exit_angle).

Strategy: Since there is no articulated preference from the user or observable pattern from the bite history, I will recommend parameters that mirror those used previously. This decision is made on the basis of consistency, given the lack of data to suggest a change is needed or wanted.

Next distance to mouth: There is no mentioned preference or indication that the previous distance was unsatisfactory, so I will maintain the same distance to ensure consistency.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers only vegetables and desires smaller bites. 

Strategy: Based on the user's preference for vegetables and smaller bites, the next food item should be selected from the remaining items that are vegetables, and the bite size should be on the smaller end of the scale, considering the user's preference for being fed in small bites. The items remaining are 'beef', 'potatoes', and 'cabbage', with the portions remaining for each being 2, 2, and 1, respectively, and all having an efficiency of 1. Given that 'beef' is not a vegetable and 'cabbage' has already been fed, leaving only 1 portion remaining, the choice falls on 'potatoes', which is a vegetable and has 2 portions remaining, indicating it has not been fully consumed. The bite size preference, referencing the previous bite history of consuming 'cabbage' in size 2.0 bites, indicates a preference for smaller bite sizes than the default 5.0.

Next food item: Since the user preferences point towards vegetables and 'potatoes' are the only vegetable option left with portions remaining, it is chosen in alignment with the user's dietary preference. There are 2 portions of 'potatoes' remaining, making it an appropriate choice for the next feeding action.

Next food item as string: 'potatoes'

Next bite size: Given the user’s stated preference for small bites and considering the bite history of consuming vegetables at a bite size of 2.0, it’s appropriate to continue with this smaller bite size to align with the user's preferences.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Only vegetables should be selected, and they should be served in small bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers only vegetables to be selected and served in small bites.

Strategy: Since the user's preferences dictate only vegetables should be selected and served in small bites, we look at the remaining items and portions: {'beef': 2, 'potatoes': 2, 'cabbage': 1}. 'Beef' is not a vegetable and therefore is not considered. Between 'potatoes' and 'cabbage', both are vegetables, but 'cabbage' has only 1 portion remaining while 'potatoes' have 2. Given the user's preference, it's efficient to finish the item with fewer portions left first, but since there's no specific order stated in the preferences for the vegetables, and considering 'cabbage' has already been consumed as per the bite history, we should continue with 'potatoes' to avoid repeatedly switching between different food items, adhering to a logical sequence and efficiency.

Next food item: 'potatoes' are chosen due to them being a vegetable per the user's preference, with an additional consideration for a smoother transition in the feeding sequence, as 'potatoes' were the most recent vegetable fed.

Next food item as string: 'potatoes'

Next bite size: The preference states bites should be small. Looking at bite history, the previous sizes were set to 2.0, which aligns with the preference for smaller bites. Therefore, maintaining the same size ensures consistency with the user's preference for small bites.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference indicates that only vegetables should be fed in small bites, which suggests adjusting the bite size for vegetables to be smaller than the default (5.0).

Strategy: Given the preference for vegetables to be fed in small bites and considering the items and portions remaining, the next food item should be a vegetable if available. The portions remaining for items are: beef (2 portions), potatoes (1 portion), and cabbage (1 portion). Since 'cabbage' is a vegetable and still has portions remaining, it should be selected next, adhering to the preference for vegetables. The bite size for vegetables, as per the user's preference for smaller bites, should be less than the default. Given the bite history where 'cabbage' was previously served in small bites of size 2.0, this bite size should be maintained for consistency and to comply with the user's preference for smaller vegetable bites.

Next food item: 'Cabbage' is chosen because it is the only vegetable left with a portion remaining, which aligns with the preference for feeding vegetables in small bites first.

Next food item as string: 'cabbage'

Next bite size: Based on the preference for smaller bites for vegetables and previous bite sizes for 'cabbage', the bite size is maintained at 2.0, consistent with the history and user preference.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference seems consistent with the default settings, as all previous bites of cabbage and potatoes were served with the same parameters.

Strategy: Since there is no explicitly stated preference in the given input and the bite history shows a consistency in the use of the default parameters for both distance_to_mouth and exit_angle, it is reasonable to continue with these settings for the next bite of cabbage.

Next distance to mouth: Since no specific preference has been indicated and previous bites have consistently used the default value, we will maintain the default distance_to_mouth.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
The user only wants vegetables, and prefers small bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers only vegetables and wants smaller bites. This means the next food item chosen should be a vegetable and the bite size should be smaller than the default.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for vegetables and smaller bites, the next food item to feed should be 'cabbage' as it's the only vegetable left. Even though the bite history shows that 'potatoes' have been previously fed, potatoes have only 1 portion remaining which needs to be consumed before moving back to 'cabbage'. As 'cabbage' is a preferred vegetable and still has portions remaining, it aligns with the preference over 'beef', which isn't a vegetable. For bite size, considering the preference for small bites and previous bite sizes of 2.0, we will continue with this smaller value to meet the user's request for small bite sizes.

Next food item: Since 'cabbage' is a vegetable and aligns with the user's preference and there's a portion remaining, it should be the next food item. Despite previous servings of 'cabbage', we are focusing on adhering to the user's preference for vegetables and small bites. 'Beef' is disregarded since it's not a vegetable, and 'potatoes' have been consumed as per the latest portion indication.

Next food item as string: 'cabbage'

Next bite size: The user prefers small bites, and the bite history consistently shows a size of 2.0, which aligns well with this preference. Therefore, maintaining this size will satisfy the user's request for smaller bites.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has consistently chosen a distance_to_mouth of 7.5 and an exit_angle of 90.0 for both cabbage and potatoes, indicating no specific preference for adjustments in distance or angle beyond the default settings.

Strategy: Since the user has not expressed any specific preferences and has maintained the same parameters for all previous bites, it is reasonable to continue with these values to ensure consistency with past successful bites.

Next distance to mouth: There is no indicated preference for changing the distance; all previous distances to mouth have been kept at 7.5, the default value.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
The user only wants vegetables and prefers to be fed in small bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to eat only vegetables and desires them in small bites, indicating a preference for smaller portions at a time.

Strategy: Since the user has a preference for vegetables, and the items remaining include 'cabbage' which is a vegetable, and considering the portions remaining 'cabbage' has zero portions left, this means it has been fully consumed. This leaves us with 'beef' and 'potatoes', out of which 'potatoes' being a vegetable fits the user's preference. Although the list shows 'cabbage', it is indicated that it has zero portions left, so it cannot be chosen. The preference for small bites suggests adjusting bite sizes to be smaller than the default. By looking at the bite history, which includes several instances of bites sized 2.0, it is advised to continue with this trend to meet the user's preference for small bites.

Next food item: The only vegetable left that has portions remaining is 'potatoes', with 1 portion left, making it the obvious choice based on the user's preference for vegetables.
Next food item as string: 'potatoes'
Next bite size: The user's desire for small bites is reflected in the bite history with a size of 2.0, which is well below the default size, suggesting that continuing with this size will meet the preference.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
The user prefers to be fed in small bites, indicating a preference for the size and possibly the careful approach during bite transfer.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers small bites, which suggests they favor careful, potentially closer approaches to ensure bite size and control are maintained.

Strategy: Given the preference for small bites, adjusting parameters to ensure the spoon does not overload and is gentle during the bite transfer is key. Since the bite history does not indicate any deviations from the default parameters, and no direct preference for distance or tilt has been expressed, we default to the values that would likely suit the general preference for small, manageable bites.

Next distance to mouth: Since the preference implies smaller, more carefully controlled bites but doesn’t specifically request the spoon to be closer or further away, and the bite history shows a consistent default value, we’ll maintain the default distance to provide a balance between comfort and control.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The preference for small bites suggests a careful approach but does not directly indicate a need for a higher or lower tilt. The bite history indicates a consistent use of the default angle, which likely facilitates a controlled bite size adequately. Therefore, we will stick with the default exit angle to ensure the food is transferred smoothly without spilling or providing too large a bite.

Summary: The user prefers only vegetables and desires them in small bites.

Strategy: The preference for vegetables only eliminates beef from the options. The remaining items are potatoes and cabbage, but cabbage has 0 portions remaining, indicating it is fully consumed. Therefore, the only viable option aligning with the stated preference and available portions is potatoes. The bite history shows a trend towards small bites (sizes around 2.0), which aligns with the user's preference for smaller bite sizes.

Next food item: Since cabbage has been fully consumed (0 portions remaining) and beef does not align with the vegetable preference, potatoes are the remaining option that fits the user's preferences. Current portions remaining for beef, potatoes, and cabbage are 2, 1, and 0, respectively.

Next food item as string: 'potatoes'

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers vegetables and desires to be fed in small bites.

Strategy: Since the user prefers vegetables, and considering the items and portions remaining, 'cabbage' would have been the ideal choice. However, there are no portions left of it or any other vegetable ('potatoes' have been considered as a vegetable in many contexts, but none is available here). The only option left that has portions remaining is 'beef'. According to the preference for small bites and considering the previous bite sizes which were consistently at 2.0, we will continue with choosing a small bite size.

Next food item: Given the user’s preference and the available items, 'beef' is the only choice left as 'cabbage' and 'potatoes' have portions remaining of 0. Despite not fitting the vegetable preference, it is the only food item remaining with available portions.

Next food item as string: 'beef'

Next bite size: The preference states small bites and looking at the bite history where the sizes were consistently around 2.0 for previous vegetables, the same logic will apply for the beef to match the user's small bite preference even though it's not a vegetable.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Only wants vegetables and requests to be fed in small bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to eat only vegetables and requests that these be served in small bites.

Strategy: Given the user's specific preference for vegetables only, along with the request for small bites, the selection of the next food item is focused on aligning with these preferences. Since the 'Items remaining' include beef, potatoes, and cabbage, with portions remaining only for beef ([2, 0, 0]), but the user only wants vegetables, this poses a preference conflict as there are no remaining portions of vegetables. However, the directive is to never choose an item that has no portions left and to always prioritize the user's preference, suggesting we hit a conflict due to the lack of vegetable options left. Despite this, it's important to recognize the preference to never feed an item with 0 portions remaining, effectively meaning we cannot select a next food item in alignment with the vegetable preference. For bite size, since the preference states a desire for small bites and previous bites sizes have been recorded as 2.0, continuing with this smaller size meets the user's request.

Next food item: Given that all portions of vegetables are fully consumed and we are left with only beef as the remaining food item with portions available, despite the user's preference for vegetables, there are no options left that align with the user's dietary restrictions. Therefore, technically, no suitable next food item can be selected based on the given constraints and the user's preferences. In adherence to the instructions to never suggest an item with 0 portions remaining and the priority to adhere to the user's preferences, this situation leaves us in a position where we cannot proceed with the feeding without violating one of the set guidelines. 

Next food item as string: ''

Next bite size: Given the user's request for small bites and considering the past bite sizes to adhere to this preference, we'll continue with the same rationale used previously despite not having a suitable food item to feed based on the remaining portions and preferences.
