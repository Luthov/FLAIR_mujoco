Alternate between rice, chicken, and vegetables using small bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to alternate between rice, chicken, and vegetables with a focus on small bites for each of these food items.

Strategy: Since there's a clear preference for alternating between rice, chicken, and vegetables in small bites, and given the portions remaining are equal for all items (2 for rice, chicken, and carrots), the strategy involves first identifying which food item comes next in the preferred rotation. Without prior bite history, the starting point defaults to the first item in the preference list, which is rice. Additionally, the preference for "small bites" dictates adjusting bite size from the default.

Next food item: Starting with rice as it's the first in the user's preference list, and all items have the same portions remaining, meaning no item has been fully consumed yet. This respects both the user's preference for food item order and the available portions.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: Preference states "using small bites," indicating that the default bite size of 5.0 should be reduced to capture the user's preference for smaller bites. Given the scale, a small bite can be interpreted as significantly smaller than the default but still substantial enough to be satisfying, thus a smaller value around 3.0 is chosen to align with "small bites" instruction.

Keep the spoon at a distance.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be kept at a distance when taking a bite.
Strategy: Given the user's preference for distance, the distance_to_mouth will be adjusted to be on the further side of the default 7.5, within the provided range. Since there's no specific preference mentioned about the exit angle and no bite history to influence the decision, the exit angle will remain at the default value.
Next distance to mouth: Preference indicates keeping the spoon further; therefore, selecting a value greater than the default 7.5.
Next distance to mouth as float: 10.0
Next exit angle: No specific preference mentioned, so keeping it at the default.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating between rice, chicken, and vegetables with small bites. 

Strategy: Given the user's preference for alternating between food items and taking small bites, the next food item should be the one following rice, based on the sequence provided (rice, chicken, vegetables). Since the last food item was rice and the user prefers small bites, this sequence will be used to determine the next food item, ensuring to follow the user's alternation pattern while also acknowledging the portions remaining for each item. The bite size should respect the user's preference for small bites, considering the last bite was larger than the smallest possible size.

Next food item: The preceding food item was 'rice', and following the user's preference to alternate between rice, chicken, and vegetables, the next item should be 'chicken', as it's the next in sequence and portions are still available for it. Current portions remaining, corresponding to items are: rice (2), chicken (2), carrots (2).

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: Since the user prefers small bites and the last recorded bite was a 3.0, which aligns with the preference for smaller bites rather than using the default size, maintaining this smaller bite size preference is appropriate.

Keep the spoon at a distance.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to keep the spoon at a distance from the mouth.

Strategy: Given the preference for keeping the spoon further away and the previous distance_to_mouth setting for rice, I'll maintain the distance at the same value used before for consistency with the user's preference. The exit angle will remain at the default since there's no specific user preference indicated for tilting.

Next distance to mouth: The preference is to keep the spoon further from the mouth, and the last distance to mouth was set at 10.0, aligning with this preference.
Next distance to mouth as float: 10.0

Next exit angle: No specific preference for tilting has been indicated; thus, the exit angle remains at the default of 90.0, also reflecting the absence of any mention of change required from the user's input or bite history.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers an alternating sequence between rice, chicken, and vegetables, specifically requesting smaller bites. 

Strategy: Following the user preference for the sequence of food items and their request for smaller bites. Since the bite history shows that rice and then chicken have been eaten most recently, the next item based on the preference should be a vegetable. Given that 'carrots' is the only vegetable option listed and aligns with the user's alternating sequence preference, it will be chosen as the next food item. Additionally, the user's preference for smaller bites guides the bite size adjustment.

Next food item: Since 'rice' and 'chicken' were the last items consumed according to the bite history, and the user prefers alternating between rice, chicken, and vegetables, the next choice should be 'carrots'—remaining portions for items: rice [2], chicken [2], carrots [2].

Next food item as string: 'carrots'

Next bite size: The preference indicates a desire for smaller bites, and the bite history shows a trend for smaller bites (3.0 for both rice and chicken). Although the default is 5.0, we'll continue with the trend of smaller bites and maintain consistency with previous selections.

Alternate between rice, chicken, and vegetables using small bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating between rice, chicken, and vegetables (carrots) with a preference for small bites. This suggests a cyclic order of feeding with an emphasis on smaller portions per bite.

Strategy: The most recent food item fed was carrots, and given the user's preference to alternate between rice, chicken, and vegetables, the next logical choice is rice to continue the cycle. The current portions remaining are 2 for each item (rice, chicken, carrots) indicating that all items are still available for feeding. The preference for small bites influences the choice of bite size, and considering the bite history where the last bite sizes were all 3.0, matching this size aligns with maintaining small bites as specified by the user.

Next food item: Following the last fed item, carrots, and adhering to the user's alternating preference, rice is the next in sequence considering all food items still have portions remaining, thus keeping the cycle intact.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The preference specifies small bites, and the bite history shows previous bite sizes were 3.0, which aligns with this request. Therefore, maintaining this bite size is consistent with the user's preference for small bites.

Summary: The user prefers alternating between rice, chicken, and vegetables, specifically asking for small bites from each food item.

Strategy: The last item fed was rice with a bite size of 3.0, following the preference for small bites and alternating between rice, chicken, and vegetables. Since all food items still have portions remaining (rice: 1, chicken: 2, carrots: 2), and following the alternate feeding preference, the next food item should logically be chicken to maintain the order. The preference specifies small bites, which aligns with the historical bite size of 3.0 for all previously fed items.

Next food item: Following the alternating order of rice, chicken, and vegetables, and considering the last item fed was rice, the next item should be chicken, which still has 2 portions remaining, maintaining the order of preference.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: Considering the preference for small bites and the previously recorded bite size of 3.0 for all items, the next bite size should again be small to adhere to the user's preference.

Alternate between rice, chicken, and vegetables using small bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference indicates alternating between rice, chicken, and vegetables, specifically requesting small bites. This involves cycling through the three food items in the stated order and adjusting the bite size to be smaller than the default.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference for alternation and small bites, and considering the last consumed food item was chicken, the next food item should be a vegetable. 'Carrots' is the only vegetable option remaining. The portions remaining for the items are rice (1), chicken (1), and carrots (2), indicating that each of these items is still available for consumption. Given the preference for small bites and observing the bite history where all previous bites were of size 3.0, we will continue with this bite size to maintain consistency with the user's preference.

Next food item: Since 'carrots' is the next item in the cycle following rice and chicken, and it has portions remaining, it is selected as the next food item to feed. The previous food item based on the bite history was 'chicken', aligning with the specified alternation preference.

Next food item as string: 'carrots'

Alternate between rice, chicken, and vegetables using small bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to alternate between rice, chicken, and vegetables with small bites.

Strategy: Since the user's preference mentions alternating between rice, chicken, and vegetables with small bites and considering the bite history where the last recorded item was 'carrots', the next food item in sequence should be 'rice'. Following the evident pattern and preference, and since all items still have portions remaining as indicated by the Portions remaining list [1, 1, 1], 'rice' is the logical next choice. The portions remaining before choosing the next item are 1 for rice, 1 for chicken, and 1 for carrots, clearly indicating that all items are still available for serving. For the bite size, given the user's preference for small bites and considering the previous bite sizes recorded in the bite history were 3.0, continuing with this size aligns with the user’s preference for smaller bite sizes.

Next food item: The next food item is chosen as 'rice' following the alternating order indicated by the user’s preference and considering it is the next in sequence after the last item 'carrots', while also ensuring the pattern of rice, chicken, and vegetables is maintained.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating between rice, chicken, and vegetables, using small bite sizes for each food item.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for alternating food items in the order of rice, chicken, and vegetables, and considering the last consumed item was rice of a small bite size (3.0), the next item should be chicken, following the sequence. Since all items have portions remaining (rice, chicken, carrots), we proceed with the next item in the sequence that has not been fully consumed. The preference for small bites is noted, and thus, the bite size will once again be small to adhere to the user's specified preference.

Next food item: Since the last consumed food item was rice, and the user's preference is to alternate between rice, chicken, and vegetables with small bite sizes, and considering that all items still have portions remaining ([1, 1, 1]), the next logical choice following the pattern and preference is chicken.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Alternate between rice, chicken, and vegetables using small bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to have their food presented in a specific order, alternating between rice, chicken, and vegetables, all while taking smaller bites of each. 

Strategy: Based on the user's preference and the bite history, the next food item should continue the cycle, alternating between rice, chicken, and vegetables, with smaller bites. The last item fed was chicken, so the next item in the sequence, following the specified order, is carrots (vegetables). Since the portions remaining for all items are [1, 1, 1], and the preference is to alternate in the order of rice, chicken, and vegetables, all items are still available for feeding. The preference for smaller bites is noted and will be adhered to with the sizing decision.

Next food item: Given the cycle follows rice, then chicken, then vegetables, and the last item fed was chicken, the logical progression is to feed carrots (vegetables) next. This also aligns with the 'Portions remaining' which includes carrots, indicating it has not yet been fully consumed.

Next food item as string: 'carrots'

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating between rice, chicken, and vegetables, specifically using small bites for each type.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for alternating between rice, chicken, and vegetables, the next logical choice following the pattern in the bite history (rice → chicken → carrots → rice → chicken → carrots → rice → chicken → carrots) would be rice. Taking into account that the portions remaining for each food item is 1, and based on the last food item consumed being 'carrots', 'rice' is the next item to continue adhering to the preference sequence. Since the preference also dictates small bites, the bite size should follow the previous small bite sizes, which have consistently been 3.0.

Next food item: Based on the pattern and the remaining portions which are 1 for each of 'rice', 'chicken', and 'carrots', and considering the preference of alternating between the three with rice being the one that comes after carrots in the given sequence, 'rice' is the natural next choice.

Next food item as string: 'rice'
