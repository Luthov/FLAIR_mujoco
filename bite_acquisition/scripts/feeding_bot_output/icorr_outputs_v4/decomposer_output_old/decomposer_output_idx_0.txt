=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to eat all the rice first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables.
Strategy: According to the user’s preference, the priority is to finish the rice, then alternate between chicken and vegetables. Since the preference for the next food item depends on the food items available and the user's specific order, we start with rice and continue fulfilling this sequence until all of it is finished, then proceed with the alternating sequence. Considering there's rice available, it should be the next choice until it is finished. As for the bite size, there's no specific preference mentioned, so we'll default to 5.0, the middle of the range.
Next food item: Since 'rice' is the first preference and there are portions of it remaining, 'rice' should be the next food item to maintain adherence to the user's preferences.
Next food item as string: 'rice'
Next bite size: There's no specific preference for bite size, and since there's no history to indicate a previous choice, we default to the middle value of 5.0.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to consume all of the rice first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables.

Strategy: Since the preference is to finish all rice before moving on to other food items and the last bite taken was rice, but there are no specific preferences mentioned for bite sizes, the default size will be used. According to the preference, after finishing rice, the next items to be fed should alternate between chicken and vegetables.

Next food item: Given that the rice has been consumed (based on the bite history and portions available), and following the user's preference to alternate between chicken and vegetables after consuming all the rice, the next food item should be chicken since it has not been fed yet. Portions remaining show that there are 2 portions each for rice, chicken, and carrots. But since rice was consumed last and following the alternating preference, chicken is next.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: No specific preference was mentioned for changing the bite size from the default, and considering the last bite size was 5.0 (default), we will continue with this value to maintain consistency and because there is no indication that a change is desired.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has no explicitly stated preference for the next bite transfer parameters based on the provided information. The previous bite was rice, with standard parameters used.

Strategy: Given the lack of specific preference and based on the standard parameters used for the previous bite (rice), the default values will be applied for the next bite of chicken. This approach ensures consistency with the previous experience, aiming for a comfortable and satisfactory bite without adjustments indicated by the user.

Next distance to mouth: Since there's no stated preference and the previous distance was at the default, we will maintain the same setting assuming it was satisfactory.

Summary: The user's preference is to first consume all of the rice, then alternate between consuming chicken and vegetables.

Strategy: Given the current portions remaining of rice, chicken, and carrots are all equal (2 each), and considering the user's preference to first consume all of the rice, the next food item to feed should be rice to adhere to this preference. Since there's no specific preference stated for bite size, we default to the given bite size of 5.0.

Next food item: Since the user's preference is to first finish all the rice and portions remaining indicate that rice is still available, rice is chosen as the next food item to feed according to the user's eating preference.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user’s preference is to feed all the rice first, then alternate between chicken and vegetables.

Strategy: Since the preference is to finish all the rice first, and the bite history indicates that rice has already been fed once with a bite size of 5.0, and considering the portions remaining {['rice', 'chicken', 'carrots']} with corresponding portions {[2, 2, 2]}, it's clear that rice is the next food item to be fed as it still has portions remaining. The bite size previously was 5.0, and since there’s no specific request to change this, we will continue with the same size. 

Next food item: Based on the preference to feed all the rice first and since there are still portions of rice remaining, the next food item should be rice. 

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: Since the previous (and initial) bite size was 5.0 and there's no specific preference requesting a change, I will maintain this bite size.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have all the rice fed first, followed by alternating bites of chicken and vegetables.

Strategy: Since all the rice has already been fed (as indicated by the bite history and the user's preference to feed all the rice first), the next step is to alternate between chicken and vegetables. Since there is no direct indication of the last bite from the bite history between chicken and vegetables, and considering the preference to alternate, the next food item should be chicken if we are strictly following the alternation pattern and considering the absence of a rice portion.

Next food item: Considering the preference to alternate between chicken and vegetables after all rice has been consumed, and since rice was the last type of food eaten, chicken should logically be the next item to alternate to.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
Next bite size: The bite history shows a consistent bite size of 5.0, and no specific preference has been stated to alter this size. Therefore, we will maintain this default bite size to align with past bites and the lack of explicit instructions to change.

Summary: The user has not expressed a direct preference, but the bite history suggests comfort or neutrality with the default parameters.
Strategy: There is no explicit preference provided by the user for adjustments to either the distance to mouth or the exit angle for the next bite, which is chicken. Based on the bite history of rice with both parameters set at their default values, it appears the user is either comfortable with or indifferent to these settings. Therefore, maintaining these default values seems like a reasonable choice for the chicken bite to ensure a consistent eating experience.
Next distance to mouth: No preference expressed and previous values were at the default; thus, maintaining the default distance.

Summary: The user prefers to consume all rice first, then alternates between chicken and vegetables.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference and the portions remaining for each food item, the next food item should be the one that conforms to the given sequence. Since the portions indicate that all three food items have equal quantities remaining and no history of bites suggests preference alterations, the decision should strictly adhere to the user's initial preference order. Given no other bites have occurred, the default bite size will be selected.

Next food item: As the preference indicates to feed all rice first and no portion of rice has been consumed yet based on the given data (empty bite history and equal portions remaining for each food), the next food item should be rice.
Next food item as string: 'rice'
Next bite size: Since no specific preference for bite size is mentioned and there's no bite history to suggest any past deviations from the default, the default bite size of 5.0 will be used.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to consume all of the rice first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables until all portions are consumed.

Strategy: According to the preference, all rice should be fed before moving onto chicken and vegetables, and they should be alternated after that. Given the portions remaining indicates there is still rice left (2 portions of rice, 2 of chicken, and 2 of carrots), the next item should be rice to adhere to the user's preference. Looking at the bite history, the last bite size was 5.0, and since there's no specified preference for adjusting the bite size, we will continue with this default value.

Next food item: The preference dictates feeding all the rice first, and since portions remaining show rice is not yet depleted, the next food item should be rice.
Next food item as string: 'rice'
Next bite size: There's no specific preference indicating a change in bite size; therefore, we will retain the default of 5.0 as used in the previous bite.

Summary: The user has not provided any explicit preference for adjusting the bite transfer parameters. Therefore, we will rely on the default settings and any implicit cues from the bite history.
Strategy: Since there is no explicit preference, and the bite history shows a single entry with default values, we will stick with these default values for both parameters. This is a conservative approach to ensure the user's comfort based on the available information.
Next distance to mouth: There is no preference or indication from the bite history that suggests a need to change from the default distance. Thus, we will keep it at the default value.

Summary: The user prefers to consume all of the rice available before proceeding to alternate between eating chicken and vegetables. 

Strategy: Given the portions remaining and the expressed user preference, we will prioritize feeding the user rice until it's fully consumed. Afterward, we will alternate between chicken and vegetables, as requested. There's no specific bite size preference mentioned, so we will default to the standard bite size.

Next food item: Since there are still portions of rice remaining and the user specified a preference to be fed all the rice first, the logical choice is rice. Current portions remaining indicate there is rice available to be served.

Summary: The user's preference is to first consume all of the rice, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables until each is finished.

Strategy: Since the preference is to first consume all of the rice, and considering the previous bite history includes 'rice' with a bite size of 5.0, along with the current portions remaining for rice being 2 (indicating rice is not yet fully consumed), the next food item should continue to be 'rice'. The bite size default is 5.0 and since there’s no specified preference for bite size to be smaller or larger, we'll continue with the default value of 5.0.

Next food item: The preference is to finish all rice first, and there are still portions of rice left according to the portions remaining. Therefore, we continue with 'rice'.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Strategy: Since the preference is to finish all of the rice before moving on to the other food items and then alternate between chicken and vegetables, the next food item should be selected based on what is remaining and the user's specified order. Considering the current portions remaining for each food item and given there's no history of previous bites to suggest a change in bite size, the default bite size will be used.

Next food item: Since rice is the user's first preference and it still has portions remaining, rice should be selected as the next food item to be fed. Current portions remaining correspond to items in the list as follows: ['rice', 'chicken', 'carrots'] with portions [2, 2, 2]. This strategy follows the user's preference by continuing to feed rice until it is fully consumed before moving onto chicken and vegetables.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to have all the rice fed first, followed by an alternating pattern between chicken and vegetables until all are consumed.

Strategy: Given the preference to finish all rice first, and since 'rice' has already been fed and remaining portions of rice are indicated as 2, rice must be selected as the next food item until its portions are depleted. Considering the portions remaining for each food item are equal and follow the pattern of the user’s preference, the choice to continue with rice aligns with the stipulated preference. The bite history indicates a previous bite size of 5.0 for rice, and without any specific instructions to alter the size, maintaining this size respects both the lack of explicit user preference on bite size change and the default setting.

Next food item: The preference is to finish all rice first. The portions remaining indicate that rice still has portions left to be consumed. Therefore, rice is selected as the next food item to be fed, adhering to the user’s stipulated eating sequence and the remaining portions of food items.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The last bite size recorded was 5.0 for rice, and there are no preferences indicating a need to adjust the bite size. Therefore, the bite size remains unchanged to respect the user's implied satisfaction with the previous size and the default parameter.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have all of the rice served first, followed by alternating servings of chicken and vegetables. 

Strategy: According to the preference and the 'Portions remaining', paired with 'Items remaining', we have the following scenario: rice (1), chicken (2), carrots (2). Since two servings of rice have already been consumed, and based on the preference, we continue serving rice until it's fully consumed, meaning we prioritize finishing the rice first. The user's bite history shows a preference for a 5.0 bite size, with no instructions to alter this size.

Next food item: Rice has portions remaining and needs to be finished before moving on to chicken or vegetables. This adheres to the user's preference of consuming all rice first.

Summary: Since there is no expressed preference for adjustments to either the distance to mouth or the exit angle for the upcoming spoonful of rice, we will rely on default settings and previous bite parameters.

Strategy: Given that the user has not expressed a preference and the past two bites have consistently used the default values for both parameters (7.5 for distance_to_mouth and 90.0 for exit_angle), we will maintain these settings for the next spoonful. This approach assumes that the default settings have been satisfactory so far, given the lack of feedback requesting adjustment.

Next distance to mouth: Since there has been no preference expressed, and the previous settings have remained unchanged, we'll keep the default distance to ensure comfort and consistency.

Summary: The user prefers to have all the rice fed first, followed by an alternate feeding between chicken and vegetables.

Strategy: Given the preference and the remaining portions, the priority is to finish the rice first. However, all portions of rice have been consumed as indicated by the bite history and the portions remaining (all rice bites have been 5.0, and there's no rice listed in the portions remaining, assuming an oversight in the input details or a misunderstanding, since 'rice' should be at 0 portions if fully consumed. If we follow the preference strictly, it's time to alternate between chicken and vegetables. Since chicken and vegetables both have equal portions and efficiency, and rice (presumably) has been finished, we'll start with chicken to align with the alternating preference after rice.

Next food item: Since rice is assumed to be fully consumed given the preference and the bite history, the next item based on user preference and portion availability, would be chicken, as it aligns with alternating between chicken and vegetables after all rice is consumed.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: No specific preference for bite size has been expressed, and the previous bites (for rice) were all at a default value of 5.0. There's no indication that a change in bite size is desired, so we'll maintain the default value.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has not expressed a specific preference based on the given information. The bite history shows consistent parameters for rice but does not give clear direction for adjustments with chicken.

Strategy: Given the lack of explicit preference and considering the consistency in previous bites, it's reasonable to maintain the default values as a baseline for this new type of food (chicken), which may have different texture and size compared to rice but without clear instruction, maintaining the status quo is prudent.

Next distance to mouth: Since there is no stated preference for distance and the bite history shows a consistent value of 7.5, it's logical to keep this distance to maintain a consistent feeding approach for the new bite type.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Summary: The user prefers to have all rice eaten first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables until both are finished.

Strategy: Overall, the user's preference leads the selection process. Since rice is preferred to be eaten first and there are portions of rice remaining, rice becomes the next item to feed. Following rice, we would alternate between chicken and vegetables, but only after the rice has been fully consumed, which aligns with user preferences. Given no specific bite size preference is mentioned, we default to a standard size.

Next food item: The portions remaining include rice (2 portions), chicken (2 portions), and carrots (2 portions). Since rice still has portions remaining and it is prioritized to be fed first according to the user's preference, rice is selected as the next food item to feed.

Next distance to mouth: No explicit preference for distance was provided, hence maintaining the previous distance of 7.5 as it seems suitable based on prior use.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: No explicit preference for tilt was given; however, the last exit angle used was 95.0, slightly higher than default, suggesting this might be a favorable choice based on past experience.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user’s preference is to be fed all of the rice first, followed by an alternation between chicken and vegetables until those are finished. 

Strategy: Given that rice still remains and the user's clear preference to finish all rice before moving on to the other food items, the next food item to feed should be rice. Considering the previous bite history both featuring bites of rice at a size of 5.0, and no specific preference stated for bite size change, we will continue with the default bite size.

Next food item: Since rice is still available and is preferred to be consumed first according to the user’s preference, the next item will be 'rice'.
Next food item as string: 'rice'

Summary: The user prefers to eat all of the rice first, followed by an alternating sequence between chicken and vegetables until all are consumed.

Strategy: Since the user's preference explicitly states to feed all of the rice first and then alternate between chicken and vegetables, and considering that all items still have portions remaining, the next food item should be rice to comply with the initial part of the preference. There is no specific preference mentioned for bite size, so the default value of 5.0 will be used.

Next food item: Based on the user's preference to eat all of the rice first and given that rice still has portions remaining (2 portions), rice should be the next food item served.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user wants all of the rice to be fed first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables until all have been consumed.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference and the portions remaining, since rice has been previously served (as indicated by the bite history), and given that the portions remaining for all items are equal, the next step is to ensure that the preference is followed. After feeding all of the rice, we should alternate between chicken and vegetables. As the previous bite was rice and all types of food items have equal portions and efficiency left, the next item should be chicken to start the alternation process.

Next food item: Following the preference to alternately feed chicken and vegetables after finishing with the rice, and considering that the previous bite was rice and we have equal portions remaining for chicken and carrots, chicken is the next logical choice to maintain the alternation and adhere to the given preference.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
Next bite size: No specific preference has been stated for adjusting the bite size from the default. The last bite size was 5.0, and since there’s no indication that the user wants a smaller or larger bite, we will stick to the default value of 5.0.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has a specific order in which they prefer to be fed: all the rice first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables until all food is consumed.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference, all the rice should be fed first. However, the bite history indicates that rice has already been served, and the portions remaining suggest there is still rice to be served amongst chicken and carrots. Given the priority to finish all of one food item before moving on to the next, and respecting the alternating pattern between chicken and vegetables after finishing the rice, the next food item should be rice to comply with the preference of finishing all rice first. The bite size has been defaulting to 5.0 according to the history, and there's no specific preference stated to adjust the size, so it will remain the default value.

Next food item: Since rice is yet to be fully consumed and it is the user's priority to have all the rice first, it is chosen as the next food item to ensure compliance with the user's preferences.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: There are no specified preferences for changing the bite size; thus, the default value of 5.0, consistent with previous bites, will be used.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has not expressed any specific preferences for distance to mouth or exit angle based on the provided bite history. Both rice and chicken were served with the same parameters, suggesting a default preference.

Strategy: Since the user has not provided any specific requests regarding the distance to mouth or exit angle, and the bite history does not indicate any changes or preferences, it is appropriate to default to the standard parameters established by prior bites.

Next distance to mouth: There's no stated preference or indication from the bite history that would suggest changing the distance to the mouth from the standard setting. Therefore, we'll maintain the default value as there's no reason to alter it based on user preference or prior experience.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Similarly, there are no cues or indications from the user's preferences or bite history that suggest a need to change the exit angle from what has been previously used. To maintain consistency and ensure user satisfaction, we'll continue with the default value.

Summary: The user's preference indicates a specific order in which food items should be fed: all rice should be given first, followed by alternating bites between chicken and vegetables.
Strategy: Since the preference is to finish all rice first, and rice still has portions remaining, the next bite should be rice to comply with the user's preference. After all rice portions are consumed, the strategy will shift to alternating between chicken and vegetables. Since the Bite History is empty and no specific bite size preference is stated, the default bite size of 5.0 will be used.
Next food item: Rice still has portions remaining and the preference clearly states to feed all the rice first.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference dictates that all of the rice should be fed first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables until both are finished.

Strategy: Based on the preference and portions remaining, rice has priority but since it has already been partially consumed and given the bite history, it's logical to continue with rice until it's finished before moving to chicken and vegetables. The portions remaining for each item are rice (2), chicken (2), carrots (2), aligning with the need to fully consume rice portions before proceeding to alternate between chicken and vegetables.

Next food item: Since the user's preference is to feed all the rice first and there are still portions of rice remaining, the next item should continue to be rice to comply with the preference order. The previous bite also included rice, maintaining consistency with the user's preference and bite history.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: No specific preference for bite size change was mentioned. The previous bite size for rice was 5.0, and with no indications to alter this size, the default value of 5.0 remains appropriate for the next bite as well.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: Since there's no explicit preference mentioned and only a single prior bite (rice, 7.5, 90.0) to reference, the user's preference remains unspecified beyond what was chosen for that single bite.
Strategy: Given the lack of explicit preference and only a single data point from the bite history, maintaining the default values for both parameters seems prudent. Changes might cause discomfort or dissatisfaction without clear indications of the user’s specific preferences.
Next distance to mouth: Since there's no stated preference to adjust the distance to mouth and the prior value matches the default, we will maintain the same value to ensure consistency with the previous experience.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have all of the rice served first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables until all food is consumed.

Strategy: Given that the preference outlines a clear order in which food items are to be served and considering the current portions remaining for each item (rice: 2, chicken: 2, carrots: 2), the next step is to continue serving rice until its portions are depleted. The previous food item served was rice, and since portions of rice are still available, it aligns with the preference to continue with rice. There is no mention of a specific preference for bite size, so the default value will be used.

Next food item: Since rice still has portions remaining (2 portions) and the user's preference is to feed all the rice first, rice is the logical choice for the next food item.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to finish all the rice before consuming any other food item. After the rice is finished, the user prefers alternating bites between chicken and vegetables.

Strategy: According to the preference stated and considering the portions remaining for each item, the priority is to finish the rice first. Based on the portions remaining {'rice': 1, 'chicken': 2, 'carrots': 2}, and considering the bite history has already included two bites of rice with a bite size of 5.0, we still need to continue with the rice until its portion is reduced to 0. After the rice, the strategy would switch to alternating between chicken and carrots, respecting the user's preference for alternating after rice is finished. The bite size will remain at the default of 5.0 as there has been no specific preference indicating the need for adjustment. 

Next food item: Since there's still a portion of rice remaining and the user's preference is to finish all the rice before moving onto the next type of food, the next food item should be rice. Current portions remaining are {'rice': 1, 'chicken': 2, 'carrots': 2}, indicating rice is not yet finished.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The bite history indicates that the previous bites of rice were both at a size of 5.0, and since there's no specific preference for changing bite size, the next bite size will remain at 5.0, consistent with the user's previous consumption pattern.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to prioritize feeding all of the rice first, and then alternate between feeding chicken and vegetables. This order must be followed strictly according to the given preference.

Strategy: Given that the bite history shows rice has been consumed in the past three bites, and considering the portions remaining, it's indicated that there's still rice left to be fed. The priority according to the user's preference is to finish all the rice before moving to the next items, which are chicken and vegetables, to be alternated. The bite size in the history has been consistently at 5.0, and no specific preference to change this was indicated, so it will remain the same.

Next food item: As the remaining portions are {"rice": 1, "chicken": 2, "carrots": 2} and the preference is to finish all rice before moving onto chicken and vegetables, the next food item should still be rice, in order to adhere to the user's preference and because there is still a portion of rice remaining.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: Since there has been no specific request to change the bite size and previous bites have been at a size of 5.0 without indication of needing adjustment, the bite size will remain at 5.0, keeping to the default value for consistency.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers all rice to be fed first, followed by an alternation between chicken and vegetables. 

Strategy: Given the preference states to feed all rice first, and the bite history indicates rice has been recently fed multiple times, and since the Portions remaining show that there is no rice left to feed (0 portions left of rice, 2 of chicken, and 2 of carrots), the next food item should adhere to the preference of alternating between chicken and vegetables. Since rice is fully consumed, we alternate to the next item in the preference list, which is chicken (since no specific start point for alternation is mentioned, we begin with chicken following the rice completion).

Next food item: Since all rice has been consumed and the preference is to alternate between chicken and vegetables afterward, the next logical choice based on portions remaining and previous consumption is 'chicken'. It maintains the preference's sequence, as rice has been fully consumed and it is now time to begin alternating between the remaining food items. 

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: Since there is no specific preference mentioned about bite size other than the default value of 5.0, and the last bite size was 5.0, the next bite size will remain at the default value. No indication was provided to adjust the bite size higher or lower.

Summary: The user has not specified any explicit preferences related to distance to mouth or exit angle. The bite history shows a consistent use of the default parameters for rice, which are 7.5 for distance to mouth and 90.0 for exit angle.

Strategy: Given the lack of explicit preference and considering the uniformity in the user’s eating history (with rice), it’s logical to apply the same parameters previously successful for rice to the next bite, which is chicken. There is no noted preference to justify deviating from these defaults.

Next distance to mouth: Since there’s no stated preference on distance and previous bites were taken at a distance of 7.5, the same distance is selected for continuity and presumed comfort.

Summary: The user's preference is to feed all the rice first, then alternate between chicken and vegetables until all food is consumed.

Strategy: Given the preference to feed rice first, which has already been fully consumed evidenced by its absence in the portions remaining, the strategy then moves to alternate between chicken and vegetables. The most recent bite history shows chicken was last fed, indicating the next item should be a vegetable, specifically carrots, to adhere to the alternating preference.

Next food item: Since 'chicken' was the last food item fed and the user prefers alternating between chicken and vegetables after all rice has been consumed, the logical next choice, adhering to the given preference and remaining portions, is 'carrots'.

Next food item as string: 'carrots'

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has not expressed a specific preference for either parameter based on the previous bites, which were all set with default values of 7.5 for distance_to_mouth and 90.0 for exit angle.

Strategy: Given the lack of expressed preference for changes in distance to mouth or exit angle, the default values will be used. This decision is based on the consistency of the parameters chosen for previous foods including rice and chicken, suggesting that the user is satisfied with these settings for different types of food.

Next distance to mouth: Since there is no expressed preference or indication that the default distance was unsatisfactory for the types of food previously consumed, the default distance will remain unchanged.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to eat all of the rice first, followed by an alternation between chicken and vegetables until both are fully consumed.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference and the history of bites, along with the portions remaining, the next food item should alternate between chicken and vegetables since all rice has been consumed (not explicitly stated but inferred from the eating sequence and preference). The last food item fed was carrots (a vegetable), so following the alternation pattern, chicken should be next. The portions remaining for chicken and carrots are both 2, which aligns with continuing the alternating pattern. For bite size, no specific preference was mentioned beyond the default, and since the previous bites were all of size 5.0 without any comments on adjusting this, we will continue with the default size of 5.0.

Next food item: Since rice has been fully consumed according to the user's preference, and the last vegetable fed was carrots, the next item, following the alternation pattern, should be chicken. There are 2 portions of chicken remaining, making it available for the next bite.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Summary: The user prefers to have all the rice fed first, then alternates between chicken and vegetables.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference and the portions remaining in each category (rice: 0, chicken: 1, vegetables(carrots): 2), since all the rice has already been consumed, we should alternate between chicken and vegetables. The most recent bite was chicken, so the next food item should be carrots, aligning with the alternating preference.
Next food item: Since the last food item fed was 'chicken' and considering the preference to alternate between chicken and vegetables after all rice is consumed, and given that carrots are the only vegetable remaining with portions to be fed, carrots should be the next food item.
Next food item as string: 'carrots'
Next bite size: No specific preference about bite size change was mentioned, hence we default to the previous bite size value to maintain consistency.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user does not have a specific stated preference for either the distance_to_mouth or the exit_angle, based on the recent bite history and absence of explicit preference cues in the input. All previous parameters for different types of food (rice, chicken, carrots) were consistent, with a distance_to_mouth of 7.5 and an exit_angle of 90.0.

Strategy: Since there is no explicit preference stated and the bite history reflects a pattern of using default settings for different types of food, it seems appropriate to continue with these default settings for the carrots. This approach will maintain a sense of consistency for the user, potentially aligning with their comfort or satisfactory prior experiences.

Next distance to mouth: There is no stated preference for adjusting the distance_to_mouth, and the bite history indicates that 7.5 has been consistently used and presumably acceptable. Therefore, it is suitable to continue with this default value.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Similar to distance_to_mouth, there is no specific preference indicated for adjusting the exit_angle, and historical data shows a consistent use of the default value of 90.0. Without any indication that a change is desired, maintaining this default value is reasonable.

Next exit angle as float: 90.0

Feed all the rice first, then alternate between chicken and vegetables.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to consume all rice first, then alternate between chicken and vegetables until none remain.

Strategy: Given the user's preference and consumption history, and considering the current portion status is rice [0], chicken [1], and carrots [1], the logical next step aligns with the alternating pattern after rice has been fully consumed. Since the last bite consumed was carrots, and chicken remains the only other food item besides carrots with portions left, the next food item should be chicken to continue adhering to the alternating pattern. The default bite size is 5.0, and since there was no preference stated to adjust it, we will continue with the default value.

Next food item: Given the preference to alternate between chicken and vegetables after consuming all rice, and the last consumed item was carrots, the next item should be chicken, as it's the only other option besides carrots that still has portions remaining.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
Next bite size: The default bite size is indicated as 5.0, with no specific user preference to alter this size; therefore, we continue with the default value.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference appears to show no specific requests for adjustments in both distance to mouth and exit angle, as all previous entries for different types of food (rice, chicken, carrots) have used the default settings (7.5 for distance_to_mouth and 90.0 for exit_angle). 

Strategy: Given the absence of explicit preferences or instructions to modify either parameter, and considering the consistency in the default values used across various foods, it's reasonable to continue using these default settings for the next bite of chicken.

Next distance to mouth: Since there's no expressed preference for changing the distance to mouth and all previous bites have maintained a distance of 7.5, this setting seems appropriate for the user's comfort and effectiveness in transferring food. 
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: With no indication that the user prefers a variation in the exit angle, and given that past meals have consistently utilized an exit angle of 90.0, maintaining this angle is advisable for consistency and user satisfaction.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Feed me all the rice first, then alternate between chicken and vegetables.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user’s preference is to be fed all the rice first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables until both are consumed.

Strategy: Since all the rice has been consumed and both chicken and vegetables are being alternated, and considering the last food item fed was chicken, the next food item should be carrots to continue adhering to the user's preference for alternating between chicken and vegetables. Current portions remaining for items are {[0, 1, 1]} corresponding to {['rice', 'chicken', 'carrots']} which indicates rice has been fully consumed, and one portion each of chicken and carrots remains. Since the preference dictates alternating between chicken and vegetables after consuming all the rice, and the most recent food item (chicken) is listed last in the bite history, the next item should follow the preference pattern and be the vegetable, carrots. The default bite size is 5.0, and no specific preference towards adjusting the bite size has been stated, so it will remain as is.

Next food item: Since rice is fully consumed and we are alternating between chicken and vegetables, with the most recent bite being chicken, the next food item as per the user's preference and remaining portions is vegetables, specifically carrots.

Next food item as string: 'carrots'

Next bite size: There is no specific preference indicated for changing the bite size from the default 5.0, so it remains unchanged following the history of bites which have consistently been at a 5.0 size.

Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has not expressed any specific preference in the given instructions. The bite history shows consistent parameters for different types of food, thus suggesting a general comfort or satisfaction with the default settings of 7.5 for distance to mouth and 90.0 for exit angle.

Strategy: Since there are no explicit preferences indicated and the bite history shows repeated use of the default parameters for both rice, chicken, and carrots, it is logical to continue with these settings for the next bite of carrots. This approach provides consistency, adhering to the apparent satisfaction with previous experiences.

Next distance to mouth: As there is no stated preference for changing the distance to mouth, and the history shows a repeating value of 7.5, it is reasonable to maintain this setting for consistency and presumed comfort.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: With no specific direction to adjust the exit angle and a bite history consistently showing an angle of 90.0, maintaining this default for exit angle is logical to ensure continuity and satisfaction based on past usage.
