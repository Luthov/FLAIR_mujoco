Start with the chicken, then the vegetables, and end with the rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user wishes to be fed in a specific order, starting with chicken, followed by vegetables, and ending with rice. Portions for all remaining items are equal, and preference dictates the feeding sequence entirely.

Strategy: Given the user's preference and the portions remaining, chicken is to be served first until it is fully depleted, followed by vegetables (in this case, spinach specifically), and then rice. As there are no prior bites indicating a preference for bite size and no specific instruction to deviate from the default, the default bite size of 5.0 will be used.

Next food item: Chicken is the first item listed in the user's preference and there are portions remaining for it, making it the next choice for feeding.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
Next bite size: No specific preference for bite size was mentioned, so the default value of 5.0 is chosen.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to start eating the chicken, followed by the vegetables, and end with the rice, consuming all portions of each food before moving to the next.

Strategy: Given the preference and the portions remaining, the next food item should still be chicken since there are portions remaining for it and it’s the first in the user's preference list. The bite history shows a previous bite size of 5.0 for chicken, and no specific preference for changing the bite size was mentioned, so the default value of 5.0 will be maintained.

Next food item: Since there is still a portion of chicken remaining and the preference is to start with chicken, continue with vegetables, and end with rice, the next item should be chicken to follow the user's preferred sequence.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: No specific preference for bite size adjustment was mentioned, and the most recent bite size used was 5.0. Therefore, maintaining the same size for consistency.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Keep the spoon close to me.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers keeping the spoon closer to them while eating.
Strategy: As the user prefers the spoon to be kept closer, and the last bite's distance to mouth was set at the minimum (5.0), which aligns with the user's preference, it makes sense to maintain this value. The exit angle from the prior bite does not offer insight into a specific preference for angle adjustment, so we will retain the default in the absence of a specific request to adjust it.
Next distance to mouth: Keeping it at the minimum value as per user's preference for closeness.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to start eating chicken, followed by vegetables, and finish with rice.

Strategy: Given the preference and portions remaining, the next item should be the one that follows the user's preference list and still has portions left to be consumed. Since chicken is first and there are still portions of it remaining, it should be chosen next. The bite size is set based on the default or any specific instructions from the user. Considering there's no preference mentioned for changing the bite size, we will use the default previously used bite history.

Next food item: Since chicken is the first preference and it still has portions left (1 portion as per the portions remaining {[1, 2, 2]} corresponding to {'chicken', 'spinach', 'rice'}), it should be chosen next following the user's preference order.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: There is no specific instruction to change the bite size from the default or previous values; the last bite size for chicken from the bite history was 5.0, so we continue with this value.

Keep the spoon close to me.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be kept close to them while eating.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference for keeping the spoon close and the historical data showing a consistent choice for a closer distance to mouth and a specific exit angle, the parameters will be adjusted to align with these preferences. The distance to mouth will be set based on the explicit request for closeness and the historical data, and the exit angle will remain at the previously chosen value since there was no specific preference indicated for changing it.

Next distance to mouth: Since the user prefers the spoon to be kept close and the historical parameters consistently show a distance of 5.0, we will maintain this distance to honor the user's preference.
Next distance to mouth as float: 5.0

Next exit angle: There is no explicit user preference regarding the exit angle, and the last chosen value was 90.0, which falls within the acceptable range. Since there’s no indication the user was dissatisfied with it, and aiming for consistency, we will keep it unchanged.

Start with the chicken, then the vegetables, and end with the rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to start with the chicken, then consume the vegetables, and finally eat the rice. 

Strategy: Since chicken still has portions remaining (1 portion), it should be the next food item to ensure the preference order is followed. We complete serving all of the chicken before moving onto the vegetables. The bite size will default to 5.0, as no specific preference for bite size alteration has been mentioned, and previously recorded bite sizes for chicken were all 5.0, indicating a consistency with the default.

Next food item: Chicken still has 1 portion remaining, and the preference is to finish chicken before moving to vegetables and rice. Previous bites were all chicken, showing a pattern of adhering to the preference order.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
Next bite size: No specific bite size preference was mentioned, and previous bites for chicken were 5.0, thus we continue with this size to maintain consistency.

Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be kept close to them.
Strategy: Since the preference is for the spoon to be close and the previous three bites all had a distance to mouth of 5.0, which is within the closer range, and the exit angle was consistently 90.0, we will maintain these values to match the user's preference and successful prior experiences.
Next distance to mouth: The user's preference explicitly states "Keep the spoon close to me," and the bite history shows a consistent choice of 5.0, indicating satisfaction with this distance.
Next distance to mouth as float: 5.0

Start with the chicken, then the vegetables, and end with the rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers eating in a specific order: first chicken, followed by vegetables, and finally rice. The preference is clear on finishing all portions of one item before moving to the next, adhering to this order as strictly as the remaining portions allow.

Strategy: According to the user’s preference and the current portions remaining, the next food item should be selected based on what is available and the specified order of eating. Despite the chicken being the first preference, it is fully consumed as indicated by the absence of chicken in the portions remaining list. Therefore, the focus shifts to vegetables, which is the next preferred item. Since 'spinach' is the only vegetable mentioned and has remaining portions, it will be selected as the next food item. As for the bite size, no specific smaller or larger preference was noted, so we will default to the standard 5.0, mirroring the previous bite sizes in the history.

Next food item: Given the completion of the chicken servings and adhering to the user's preference to have vegetables next, 'spinach' is selected as the next food item to be served, as it is currently available and matches the preference sequence.

Next food item as string: 'spinach'

Next bite size: No specific preference for bite size adjustments was indicated. Given that all previous bites of chicken were at a 5.0 size and considering consistency without any other direction, it is reasonable to maintain this bite size for spinach.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be kept close to them during feeding.
Strategy: Since the user's preference explicitly states to keep the spoon close, and all previous bites with chicken were with the distance to mouth set to 5.0, we will adjust the distance_to_mouth to be closer according to the user's preference. There's no specific preference mentioned for the exit angle, so we'll maintain the default value as there's no indication the user wants it changed based on the current food type or past preferences.
Next distance to mouth: The preference indicates "closer," and the bite history shows a consistent distance of 5.0 for chicken, which suggests the user is comfortable with this distance for all food types. Therefore, we'll choose the closest option available.
Next distance to mouth as float: 5.0
Next exit angle: No specific preference was mentioned for the exit angle, and the user's past bites have all used a 90.0 angle, indicating satisfaction with this default setting. Since there's no expressed desire for a change, we'll stick with the default.

Start with the chicken, then the vegetables, and end with the rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to start eating chicken, followed by vegetables, and end with rice. This preference dictates the order in which food items are chosen for feeding, with each type of food to be fully consumed before moving to the next in the order.

Strategy: Given the preference and considering the portions remaining, 'chicken' has been fully consumed as indicated by its corresponding portion of 0. Thus, the next choice according to preference and portions should be 'spinach', which is classified under vegetables and has portions remaining. The bite history suggests a consistent bite size of 5.0 for all types of food, which aligns with the default value and shows no specific preference for adjusting size. Therefore, the bite size will remain at the default value of 5.0.

Next food item: 'Spinach' is chosen as the next food item as 'chicken' is already fully consumed, and the user’s preference directs to feed vegetables next, in which 'spinach' has portions remaining.
Next food item as string: 'spinach'

Start with the chicken, then the vegetables, and end with the rice.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference for the sequence of food items to be fed is to start with chicken, followed by vegetables, and ending with rice. This sequence should be followed strictly based on the portions remaining for each food item.

Strategy: Given the portions remaining for each of the items (chicken: 0, spinach: 1, rice: 2) and adhering strictly to the user's stated preference of consuming all of one food item before moving onto the next, the next food item to be chosen is spinach, as all portions of chicken have been consumed and the next preference is vegetables. The bite history suggests the default bite size of 5.0 has been used for previous servings without any specific preference indicating a change in bite size. Therefore, the next bite size will remain the default value, as no preference for changing the size has been indicated.

Next food item: The next food item is chosen based on the user's preference and the portions remaining. Since chicken is fully consumed (0 portions remaining) and spinach is next in the preference list with portions still available (1 portion remaining), spinach becomes the next food item to feed. 

Next food item as string: 'spinach'

Next bite size: No specific preference for bite size change was indicated, therefore, the default bite size of 5.0 will be maintained. This decision is also supported by the consistency observed in the bite history, where previous bite sizes have been 5.0.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to start feeding with chicken, followed by vegetables, and end with rice.

Strategy: Since the user prefers to eat one type of food before moving on to the next, and based on the portions remaining where chicken is already fully consumed (0 portions remaining), the next food item in line following the user's preference and portions remaining would be vegetables, specifically spinach, as there is still a portion remaining. After spinach is finished, the remaining portions indicate rice should be fed last.

Next food item: Given the user’s preference order, and that chicken is fully consumed (not explicitly stated in the input details but inferred from the progression of the provided bite history), and since spinach (the vegetable in the list) still has a portion remaining, it should be the next food item according to the user's preference sequence. The next after spinach, based on portions remaining and user preference, will be rice, but only after spinach is fully consumed.

Next food item as string: 'spinach'

Next bite size: The bite size preference has not been explicitly stated to change, so it defaults to the previously used size from the bite history, which is 5.0, indicating that the user is comfortable with this size.
