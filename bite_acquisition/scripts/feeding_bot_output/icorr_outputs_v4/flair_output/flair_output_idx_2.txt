Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of beef, 2 portions of potatoes, and 2 portions of salad left on the plate.
Strategy: Given the preference for meat and larger bites, the strategy will focus on serving the remaining portion of beef first with a larger bite size, following the previous bites' parameters for a consistent eating experience.

Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of beef, 2 portions of potatoes, and 2 portions of salad remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Given the preference for meat, the plan will feed all of the beef first before considering other food items. The beef will be served in larger bites, consistent with the previously preferred bite size and transfer parameters.
Next bite: Feed beef
Next bite as list: ['beef']
Next bite size: Given the preference for larger bites, a large bite similar to past preferences will be chosen.
Next bite size as float: 8.0
Next distance to mouth: The default value for distance to mouth will be used, as there's no indication to change it from the preference.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: Based on previous preferences, a slightly higher tilt when exiting the mouth will be used.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no beef portions left, 2 portions of potatoes, and 2 portions of salad left on the plate.
Strategy: Since the preference explicitly states a desire for only meat and with larger bites, unfortunately, as there are no meat items left (beef portions are at 0), based on the guidelines provided, I must choose not to feed a bite from the remaining items.
