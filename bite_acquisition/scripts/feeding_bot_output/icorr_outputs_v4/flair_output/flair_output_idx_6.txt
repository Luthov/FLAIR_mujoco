Strategy: Given the preference for alternating bites of rice, chicken, and vegetables without repeat, and considering the past bites which are now irrelevant for future bites due to their consumption, my strategy is to continue the sequence by providing a bite of chicken followed by a bite of carrots to maintain the alternating pattern and honor the preference of not repeating any bites until each food item is consumed evenly.
