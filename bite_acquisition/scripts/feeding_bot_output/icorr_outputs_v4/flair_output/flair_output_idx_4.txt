=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 2 portions of rice, 1 portion of spinach, and 2 portions of broccoli left on the plate.
Strategy: Since the preference indicates alternating between rice and vegetables, and the most recent bite was spinach (a vegetable), the next bite should be rice to maintain the alternation. After rice, the sequence will follow with a vegetable, preferring to alternate the type of vegetable if possible.
