=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of chicken, 1 portion of rice, and 2 portions of peas left.
Strategy: Given the preference for alternating bites of chicken and rice, I will follow this pattern first. As larger bites are preferred and should be further away, I will accommodate that in the parameters. After depleting chicken and rice, peas will be considered.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There is 1 portion of chicken, 1 portion of rice, and 2 portions of peas left on the plate.
Strategy: Given the preference for alternating bites of chicken and rice, and considering the preference for larger bites and the spoon to be further away, I will alternate bites of chicken and rice first. Since peas have the highest quantity, they will be fed last, maintaining the principle of finishing the items with fewer portions first unless otherwise specified.
Next bite: Feed chicken
Next bite as list: ['chicken']
Next bite size: Since the preference is for larger bites, I'll opt for a larger bite size similar to the past choices.
Next bite size as float: 8.0
Next distance to mouth: Since the preference is for the spoon to be further away from the user, I'll choose a value that reflects this, slightly above the default.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 0 portions of chicken left, 1 portion of rice left, and 2 portions of peas left.
Strategy: Since there's no chicken left and the preference is for alternate bites of chicken and rice, the next best approach is to feed the remaining portion of rice followed by the remaining portions of peas, taking into account your preference for larger bites and the spoon being further away.
Next bite: Feed rice
Next bite as list: ['rice']
Next bite size: Since you prefer larger bites, the next bite will be larger than the default size.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 0 portions of chicken, 1 portion of rice, and 2 portions of peas left.
Strategy: Given the preference for larger bite sizes and an alternate bites pattern of chicken and rice, but with chicken now unavailable, I will feed rice next following the previously established preferences and patterns.
Next bite: Feed rice
Next bite as list: ['rice']
Next bite size: Given your preference for larger bites, I will select a large bite size similar to past bites.
Next bite size as float: 8.0

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no portions of chicken or rice left, only peas with 2 portions remaining.
Strategy: Given the absence of chicken and rice, and the preference for large, alternate bites of these, the strategy focuses on fulfilling the stated preference for spoon distance and bite size using the only available item - peas.
Next bite: Feed peas
Next bite as list: ['peas']
Next bite size: Given the preference for larger bites in the past, I'll continue with a larger bite size.
Next bite size as float: 8.0
Next distance to mouth: The preference indicates a desire for the spoon to be further away; therefore, I'll choose a distance greater than the default.
Next distance to mouth as float: 10.0

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no portions of chicken or rice left, but there are 2 portions of peas remaining.
Strategy: Since you prefer larger bites and for the spoon to be further away, and given that only peas are remaining with your preference for alternate bites of chicken and rice not applicable, my strategy is to feed you peas in a manner consistent with your last preferences for bite size, distance to mouth, and exit angle.
Next bite: Feed peas
Next bite as list: ['peas']
Next bite size: Based on your previous bites, I'll choose a larger bite size.
