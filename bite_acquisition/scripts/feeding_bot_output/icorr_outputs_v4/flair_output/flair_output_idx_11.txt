Food Items Left: There are 2 portions each of rice, peas, and corn left on the plate.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 2 portions remaining of rice, peas, and corn.
Strategy: Since the preference is to feed only rice, one spoonful at a time, and to keep the bites large, I will focus solely on serving the remaining rice portions in large bites until they are finished.

Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of rice, 2 portions of peas, and 2 portions of corn left on the plate.
Strategy: Given your strong preference for rice and to feed it to you one spoonful at a time with large bites, I will prioritize feeding you the remaining portion of rice first, following the specified bite size and transfer parameters from previous preferences.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of rice, 2 portions of peas, and 2 portions of corn left on the plate.
Strategy: Since the preference is to feed rice one spoonful at a time and keep the bites large, the strategy is to feed all the remaining portion of rice before moving on to peas and corn.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no more portions of rice left, but there are 2 portions each of peas and corn remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Since there is a preference for rice which is no longer available, the next best approach according to the rules provided would be to alternate between the remaining items, peas and corn, to ensure a varied dining experience. However, since you preferred large bites of rice previously, I will maintain a similar approach for consistency.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no portions of rice left, 2 portions of peas, and 2 portions of corn left.
Strategy: Since rice is preferred but has been fully consumed, and there's a preference for larger bite sizes with specific transfer parameters, the strategy will involve alternating between peas and corn to maintain meal variety.
Next bite: Feed peas
Next bite as list: ['peas']

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no portions of rice left, 1 portion of peas, and 2 portions of corn remaining.
Strategy: Since the preference states to feed rice first but there is no rice left, and given the past bites and preferences haven't explicitly stated the next preference, a commonsense approach will be used to feed peas next to follow the instruction not to feed the same item consecutively twice and to maintain bite variability.
Next bite: Feed peas

Food Items Left: There are no portions of rice and peas left, but there are 2 portions of corn remaining.
