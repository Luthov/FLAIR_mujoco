Food Items Left: There are 2 portions of chicken, rice, and peas left on the plate.
Strategy: My strategy is to feed larger bites of chicken first, fulfilling the preference for larger bites of chicken, followed by smaller bites of rice, considering that peas have not been mentioned specifically in the preference and thus can be incorporated as desired based on bite variability after chicken and rice.
Next bite: Feed chicken
Next bite as list: ['chicken']
Next bite size: Choosing a larger bite of chicken per the given preference.
Next bite size as float: 7.0

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of chicken, 2 portions of rice, and 2 portions of peas left on the plate.
Strategy: Given the preference for larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice and considering the previous consumed bites, the strategy will be to feed the remaining portion of chicken first to adhere to the preference, then alternate between rice and peas to ensure bite variability and to respect the preference for bite sequencing.
Next bite: Feed chicken
Next bite as list: ['chicken']
Next bite size: Since the preference is for larger bites of chicken, and the previous bites were of a significant size, a similarly sized bite will be chosen.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no portions of chicken left, 2 portions of rice, and 2 portions of peas remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Given the preference for chicken followed by rice, and considering chicken is no longer available, the next priority is to alternate between rice and peas to maintain bite variability and honor the instruction of not feeding the same item consecutively twice when possible.

Food Items Left: There are no portions of chicken left, 2 portions of rice, and 2 portions of peas remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Since there's a preference to not eat the same item consecutively twice and prioritize variability, and considering the chicken is all gone, I plan to alternate between rice and peas to ensure a variety of tastes and textures. 
Next bite: Feed rice

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are zero portions of chicken, one portion of rice, and two portions of peas left on the plate.
Strategy: Since chicken is preferred but is no longer available and considering past preferences for larger bites and the sequence in which items were consumed, the strategy will be feeding rice next to maintain variety, followed by peas in order to evenly distribute the remaining portions.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no portions of chicken left, 1 portion of rice left, and 2 portions of peas left on the plate.
Strategy: Since chicken is finished and cannot be prioritized, I will follow the rule of not feeding the same item consecutively twice and prioritize the item with more quantity, starting with peas. After peas, rice will be served to maintain variety and follow the portion sizes rule.
