Since all the chicken has been consumed, the next in line as per preference is the rice. As per the past bites, it's evident you were given smaller bite sizes, so we will continue with slightly smaller-than-average bites for rice and follow with peas to adhere to your preference and ensure a pleasant eating experience.
