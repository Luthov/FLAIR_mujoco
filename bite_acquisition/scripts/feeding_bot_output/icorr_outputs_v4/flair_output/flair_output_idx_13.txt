=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no chicken portions left, 1 portion of rice, and 2 portions of peas left.
Strategy: Given the current preference and portions, peas should be fed next since there's a higher quantity of peas relative to rice, aiming at distributing the bites evenly and providing variety.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no chicken portions left, 1 portion of rice, and 2 portions of peas remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Considering the order of bites and preference previously expressed, along with prioritizing bite variability and making use of the remaining portions, I will alternate between feeding rice and peas to maintain a balanced and varied intake, starting with peas because there are more portions of peas left.
