=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are one portion each of carrots, chicken, and rice left on the plate.
Strategy: Given the preference to start with a bite of vegetables and then alternate between chicken and rice, while acknowledging all three items have the same remaining portions, the sequence should continue from the last item consumed. Since rice was the last item eaten, the sequence dictates a vegetable (carrot) should be next, followed by chicken, then rice, adhering to the alternating preference.
