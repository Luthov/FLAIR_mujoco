Food Items Left: There are 2 portions remaining each of rice, chicken, and peas on the plate.
Strategy: My strategy for bite sequencing is to alternate between the different food items to ensure variety and a balanced meal experience, since there's no specified preference for order or combination of foods.

Next bite as list: ['rice']
Next bite size: Since there is no specific preference, I will choose the default bite size.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
Next distance to mouth: You prefer the spoon to be closer to you, so I'll choose a value slightly lower than the default.
