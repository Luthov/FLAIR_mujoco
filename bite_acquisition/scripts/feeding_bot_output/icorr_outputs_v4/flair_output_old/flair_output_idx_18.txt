Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of carrots, 1 portion of chicken, and 2 portions of rice left on the plate.
Strategy: Given the preference to start with vegetables and then alternate between chicken and rice, given that we already started with a vegetable, the next item should be chicken or rice. Since both have to be alternated and rice has more portions left, but preference was to alternate, we'll continue with this pattern.
