Food Items Left: There are 2 portions each of beef, potatoes, and salad left on the plate.
Strategy: Since the preference is only for meat, I will feed the beef first in larger bites and faster, respecting the specified preference for meat over other food types. After the beef is consumed, no further items will be served unless the preference changes.

Food Items Left: There are 2 portions of beef, 2 portions of potatoes, and 2 portions of salad left on the plate.
Strategy: Given the preference for meat, I will prioritize feeding the beef until it is finished, then no others as meat is the only preferred item.
Next bite: Feed beef
Next bite as list: ['beef']
Next bite size: Since the preference is for larger bites and the previous bite size was 8.0, I will continue with this approach.
Next bite size as float: 8.0
Next distance to mouth: Given no specific preference for changing the distance of the spoon to mouth, I will use the default value.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: Since a tilt is requested for faster feeding and considering the previous tilt was slightly higher for facilitating this, an angle of 95.0 will be used again.

Food Items Left: There are beef, potatoes, and salad left on the plate, with 1, 2, and 2 portions remaining respectively.
Strategy: Given the preference for meat and larger, faster bites, the strategy will prioritize feeding the remaining portion of beef first, followed by alternating between potatoes and salad for variety, in accordance with the preference and past behavior indicating larger bites with a slightly higher exit angle.
