=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of carrots, 2 portions of chicken, and 2 portions of rice left.
Strategy: Based on the preference to consume vegetables first, followed by alternating bites of chicken and rice, all vegetables will be consumed before moving on to the proteins and carbs. Given previous bites were all medium-sized, medium bites will continue, and since there's a preference for keeping the spoon far, the distance will be maximized within the given limits.
