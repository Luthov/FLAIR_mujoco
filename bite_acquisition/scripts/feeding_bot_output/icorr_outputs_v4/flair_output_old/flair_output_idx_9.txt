Food Items Left: There are 2 portions remaining of rice, chicken, and peas on the plate.
Strategy: Given the preference to avoid vegetables and keep the bites small with a slight tilt of the spoon, I will alternate between feeding rice and chicken to respect the preference for avoiding vegetables. Since the request is to keep bites small, I will select a below-default bite size and adhere to the slight tilt instruction by modifying the exit angle accordingly.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of rice, 1 portion of chicken, and 2 portions of peas remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Considering the preference to avoid vegetables and give only rice and chicken with small bite sizes and a slightly tilted spoon, I will alternate between rice and chicken, starting with rice since it was the first item listed in the preference and to follow a similar pattern to the past bites sequence.
Next bite: Feed rice
Next bite as list: ['rice']
Next bite size: Since past bites with rice have been slightly smaller than the default and to keep bites small as requested, a smaller bite size will be chosen.
