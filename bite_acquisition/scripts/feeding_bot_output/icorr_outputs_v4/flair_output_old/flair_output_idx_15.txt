=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of chicken, 2 portions of rice, and 2 portions of peas left on the plate.
Strategy: Given the preference for larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice, and considering the previous bites of chicken were all of a larger size, the strategy is to continue with chicken first in a large bite size, then move to alternating smaller bites of rice and peas to maintain bite variety and adhere to preferences and rules provided.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no chicken portions left, 2 portions of rice, and 2 portions of peas left on the plate.
Strategy: Due to the preference for larger bites of chicken which are now depleted, I'll alternate between rice and peas to maintain bite variability and follow the rule of not feeding the same item consecutively twice, starting with rice.
Next bite: Feed rice
Next bite as list: ['rice']
Next bite size: Since there's no specific preference mentioned for rice and following previous trends, I'll choose the default size for rice to ensure a comfortable bite.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no chicken portions left, but there are 2 portions each of rice and peas remaining.
Strategy: Based on your preference for larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice and considering chicken is finished, we will alternate between rice and peas to provide variety and adhere to the guideline of not feeding the same item consecutively twice. However, since chicken is your preferred item and it's finished, we'll prioritize rice next as it was mentioned specifically in your preference.
