Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of rice, 1 portion of chicken, and 2 portions of spinach left on the plate.
Strategy: Based on your preference to feed rice first then alternate between chicken and vegetables, since the rice has only one portion left, I will feed the rice first, followed by alternating between chicken and spinach. Since there are more portions of spinach than chicken, I will start with chicken to ensure an even distribution of the bites.

Strategy: According to the preference for rice to be eaten first, then alternate between chicken and vegetables, the next logical step is to follow the alternating sequence. Since rice is unavailable and understanding the need to alternate, the next choice should focus on chicken to maintain the sequence.
