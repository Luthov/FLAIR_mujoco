=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of chicken, 1 portion of rice, and 2 portions of peas left on the plate.
Strategy: Since the preference is to alternate bites of chicken and rice, the next bite will be peas to adhere to the instructions of feeding larger bites of alternating foods until all portions of those are finished, given there are no more chicken and rice to alternate between. The peas will then be fed to ensure variety and to utilize all remaining portions.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of chicken, 1 portion of rice, and 2 portions of peas remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Follow the preference for alternating bites of chicken and rice first, as specified, and then proceed to serve peas, as they are the only item left. Larger bite sizes and a further spoon distance will be accommodated.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of chicken, 1 portion of rice, and 2 portions of peas left.
Strategy: Since the preference indicates alternating between chicken and rice, and considering the past bites and remaining portions, I plan to continue this pattern, alternating between these two items, starting with chicken as it was the last mentioned preference before peas.
Next bite: Feed chicken

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no portions of chicken left, 1 portion of rice and 2 portions of peas remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Since the preference is to alternate bites of chicken and rice, but chicken is no longer available, focus will shift to feeding rice next to adhere to the preference hierarchy and then peas.
Next bite: Feed rice
Next bite as list: ['rice']
Next bite size: Since the preference indicates larger bites and past bites were sized at 8.0, the same will be chosen to maintain consistency.
Next bite size as float: 8.0
Next distance to mouth: The preference asks for the spoon to be further away, mirroring the past distance value of 10.0.
Next distance to mouth as float: 10.0

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no portions of chicken left, 1 portion of rice, and 2 portions of peas remaining.
Strategy: Since there are no portions of chicken left and alternate bites of chicken and rice were preferred, the best strategy is to prioritize the remaining portion of rice next, as per the preference for alternating bites, followed by finishing off with peas.
Next bite: Feed rice
Next bite as list: ['rice']
Next bite size: Since a preference for larger bites was indicated, and previous sizes have been larger, I will continue with a larger bite.
Next bite size as float: 8.0
Next distance to mouth: Since the preference included for the spoon to be further away, I will stick to a distance further than the default value.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 2 portions of peas remaining on the plate, with no portions of chicken or rice left.
Strategy: Since the preferred sequence of chicken and rice cannot be followed due to their absence, and peas are the only item remaining, I will feed peas while respecting the preference for larger bites and maintaining a further distance.
Next bite: Feed peas
Next bite as list: ['peas']
Next bite size: I plan to choose a larger bite size in alignment with the preference for larger bites.
Next bite size as float: 8.0
Next distance to mouth: Given the preference for the spoon to be further away, I will increase the distance from the default.
