=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of rice, 2 portions of peas, and 2 portions of corn left on the plate.
Strategy: Since there's a preference to feed only the rice first, one spoonful at a time, and keep the bites large, the strategy would be to serve the remaining portion of rice first in a large bite, followed by alternating between peas and corn according to the general guidance for variety.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no portions of rice left, but there are 2 portions of peas and 2 portions of corn remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Since there is no rice left which was the preferred item, and both peas and corn have equal portions remaining, I will alternate between feeding peas and corn to provide variety.
Next bite: Feed peas

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no portions of rice remaining, 2 portions of peas, and 2 portions of corn left on the plate.
