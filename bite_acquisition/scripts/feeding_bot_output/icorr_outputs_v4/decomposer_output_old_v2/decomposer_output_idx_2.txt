I only want meat.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to only eat meat within the given options, explicitly indicating a desire to consume meat items exclusively.

Strategy: Given the user's explicit preference for meat, and with available items being beef, potatoes, and salad, beef is the only item that fits the preference of meat. Since each item has corresponding portions remaining mentioned as [2, 2, 2], this suggests beef is available for serving and should be chosen as the next food item to conform to the user's preference. The preference does not express any desire for adjusting the bite size; thus, the default value of 5.0 will be used.

Next food item: The choice of 'beef' aligns with the user's meat-only preference and the fact that there are still portions of beef remaining. Other items, despite being available, do not meet the dietary preference specified.

Next food item as string: 'beef'

Next bite size: With no specific preference stated for bite size, the default value of 5.0 is selected to maintain a moderate serving size.

Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Tilt the spoon slightly when feeding me. Feed me with larger bites.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers a slight tilt when feeding and larger bites.
Strategy: To accommodate the preference for a slight tilt, the exit angle will be adjusted from the default. The preference for larger bites suggests adjusting the distance to mouth could potentially allow for a larger spoonful, but the user's preference does not explicitly request a closer or further distance. Therefore, the distance to mouth will remain at the default.
Next distance to mouth: No specific preference was indicated for the distance to mouth, so it remains at the default value.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: Since the user prefers the spoon to be tilted slightly when feeding, the exit angle will be adjusted higher than the default but within the given range to ensure a gentle tilt.
Next exit angle as float: 95.0

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
I only want meat and prefer larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user only wants to eat meat and prefers larger bites than the default size.

Strategy: Based on the preference for only meat and larger bites, and given the available food items, the next item should be beef since it's the only meat option left and there are still portions remaining. The user's preference for larger bites will inform the choice of bite size.

Next food item: Given the user's explicit preference for meat, beef is the chosen next food item because it aligns with their dietary preference and there are portions remaining. The portions remaining according to the information provided are 2 for beef, 2 for potatoes, and 2 for salad. Since the 'beef' matches the user's preference and there's still beef available, it's selected as the next food item.

Next food item as string: 'beef'

Next bite size: The user prefers larger bites. The last recorded bite size was 5.0, but to better align with the userâ€™s preference for larger bites, the bite size will be increased from the default setting. Considering the user's preference and with no exact number given for a larger bite, a value greater than the previous or default size but within the specified range will be chosen.

Next bite size as float: 7.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Tilt the spoon slightly when feeding me.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be tilted slightly when feeding them.
Strategy: Based on the user's preference for a slight tilt, and considering the previous exit angle used was 95.0, which is a higher tilt than the default, we'll adjust the exit angle accordingly. The distance to mouth will remain unchanged as there is no specific preference indicating a need to adjust closer or further from the default.
Next distance to mouth: Since there's no specific preference for distance, we will keep it at the default.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: Given the preference for a slight tilt and the successful previous exit angle, we will maintain a similar tilt to ensure comfort and preference alignment.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
The user only wants meat and prefers larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user only wants to eat meat and prefers larger bites of food.

Strategy: Since the user prefers meat, the next food item to be chosen should be beef, given it's the only meat option available and still has portions remaining. Since the user prefers larger bites and the bite history shows a trend towards larger bites with the most recent being 7.0, a continuation of this preference should be reflected in the bite size choice.

Next food item: Beef is the next food item since it aligns with the user's preference for meat, and there is still a portion remaining. The current portions remaining corresponding to the food items are: beef (1), potatoes (2), salad (2).

Next food item as string: 'beef'

Next bite size: The user prefers larger bites, and the most recent bite history shows a bite size of 7.0. To align with their preference for larger bites, maintaining or slightly increasing this value would be appropriate. However, to ensure a pleasant eating experience while still adhering to the user's preference for larger bites, a slight increase will be chosen.

Next bite size as float: 7.5
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be tilted slightly when feeding.
Strategy: Since the preference indicates a slight tilt and the recent history shows an exit angle of 95.0, which is a tilt above the default, the tilt should be maintained to meet the user's needs. The distance to mouth has no specified preference, so it will remain unchanged.
Next distance to mouth: No specific preference has been provided, thus sticking to the historical value used.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: User preference suggests a slight tilt, which aligns with the exit angle used in previous bites. Maintaining the same slight tilt to match the user's preference.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
I only want meat. Feed me with larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to only eat meat, specifically requesting larger bites of it.

Strategy: The user has expressed a clear preference for meat, which directs us to choose 'beef' as the next food item since 'beef' is the only meat option available and still has portions remaining. Given the preference for larger bites and observing the bite history where the size has progressively increased, we should choose a size larger than the most recent to fulfill the user's request for "larger bites."

Next food item: 'Beef' is still available (portions remaining for items are [1, 2, 2] for beef, potatoes, and salad respectively), aligning with the user's preference for meat. The bite history shows a preference towards increasing the size of each bite, which also aligns with the user's request for larger bites.

Next food item as string: 'beef'

Next bite size: Observing the bite history, which shows an increasing trend ([5.0, 7.0, 7.5]), and considering the preference for larger bites, we select a bite size larger than the most recent, which was 7.5. A value of 8.0 is chosen to respect the user's preference for larger bites without making an abrupt increase.

Next bite size as float: 8.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Tilt the spoon slightly when feeding me.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be tilted slightly when being fed.
Strategy: Since the user's preference includes a slight tilt, the exit angle should be adjusted away from the default but should not be extreme. The history shows a consistent preference for a slightly higher tilt than the default. The distance to mouth will remain unchanged since there is no specific preference indicating it should be adjusted.
Next distance to mouth: Since there's no indication from the user to adjust the distance to mouth, we'll keep it as it has been previously.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: The user's preference for a slight tilt and historical data suggests they are comfortable with the previously used slightly higher exit angle. We will maintain this for consistency and to honor their preference.
Next exit angle as float: 95.0

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
The user wants only meat with larger bites.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to be fed only meat with larger bites than the default.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for meat and larger bites, and considering the remaining portions of items, the logical choice is to continue with beef, as it is the only meat item listed and previous bite history shows an inclination towards larger sizes. Since the 'Portions remaining' detail for beef is 0, meaning it has been fully consumed, and considering the strict adherence to user preference and instructions to not choose an item that has been fully consumed, no valid food item remains that matches the preference. Despite the preference for larger bite sizes, no selection for food item can be made, which necessitates the choice of not feeding a bite.

Next food item: Given the user's preference for meat with no remaining portions of meat to feed (beef is fully consumed), no suitable next food item matches the criteria.

Next food item as string: ''

Next bite size: Since there's no food item selected based on the user's preference and portions remaining, adjusting bite size is not applicable. However, given the mandate to always suggest a value, we default to the general preference for larger bite sizes indicated by the user and the trend in the bite history.

Next bite size as float: 8.5
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
The spoon should be tilted slightly when feeding.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be tilted slightly when feeding.
Strategy: Given the user's preference for a slight tilt during feeding, the exit angle needs to be adjusted to accommodate this preference. The bite history shows a consistent choice of an exit angle slightly higher than the default of 90.0, which aligns with their preference for a tilt. The distance to the mouth has consistently been 7.5, with no specific preference indicating it should be closer or further, so it will remain unchanged.
Next distance to mouth: No preference for distance changes was mentioned, so it remains at the default value, consistent with bite history.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: Preference for a slight tilt has been previously met with an exit angle of 95.0, indicating a slight increase from the default is preferred, matching user preference and previous choices.
