 RESPONSE:
Food Items Left: There are 5 portions each of carrot, chicken, and rice left on the plate.
Strategy: The plan will be to alternate between bites of rice and grilled chicken, as per your preference, and save the steamed carrots for last, adjusting the bite size, distance to mouth, and exit angle based on each food's specific transfer preference and bite preference.
Next bite: Since the last bite was rice, the next should be grilled chicken, according to your alternating preference.
Next bite (accounting for efficiency): Choosing grilled chicken remains the plan as efficiency does not override your clear preference for alternating between rice and chicken.
Next bite as list: ['chicken']
Next bite size: Given your preference for larger pieces of chicken, the bite size will be slightly larger than default.
Next bite size as float: 0.5
Next distance to mouth: Since you prefer the spoon to be held slightly farther away for rice, but there's no specific distance mentioned for chicken, the default value will be chosen.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: Considering the preference to tilt the spoon downward for chicken, which implies a lower exit angle than default.
