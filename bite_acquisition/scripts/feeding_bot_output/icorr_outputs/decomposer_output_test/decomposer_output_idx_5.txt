Smaller bites for rice but bigger bites for other foods.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers smaller bites for rice but larger bites for any other food.

Strategy: Given there's no bite history, we'll default to the user's preference for determining bite size. Since rice prefers smaller bites and others prefer larger bites, we'll begin with an item that hasn't been served yet and match the bite size preference. To ensure a balanced meal, we'll select an item that hasn't been served, aiming to rotate through the food types to provide variety. 

Next bite size: Since there's no history, we'll go for rice with a smaller bite given the preference. Thus, choosing a smaller bite size closer to 1.0. 

Next bite size as float: 2.0

Next food item: Starting with rice due to the specified preference for smaller bites for rice and since we aim to rotate through the food items for variety.

Summary: The user has no stated preference for the next spoonful of food.
Strategy: Since there's no expressed preference or prior bite history to derive preferences from, we'll use the default values for both parameters to ensure a neutral and presumably comfortable bite for rice, which typically doesn't require specialized adjustments.
Next distance to mouth: No preference has been provided, and there's no bite history to suggest a deviation from the default distance, so we'll stay with the standard setting.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: With no specified preference or historical data to suggest a need for adjustment, the default angle seems the most appropriate choice for a general food type like rice.

Summary: The user prefers smaller bites for rice and larger bites for other foods. 

Strategy: To adhere to the user's preference for smaller bites for rice and larger bites for other foods, and considering the history of feeding rice with a bite size of 2.0 as the most recent action. Seeing as each food item must be offered in turn and balancing the user's preferences with a variety of foods, the next choice should shift from rice to another food item, also considering the aim for a larger bite size for foods other than rice.

Next bite size: Since the next food item will not be rice and the user prefers larger bites for foods other than rice, a larger bite size should be selected. The default is 5.0, yet to clearly cater to the "larger bites" preference, a value moderately above 5.0 should be chosen. 

Next bite size as float: 6.0

Next food item: The previous food item fed was 'rice'. To ensure variety and adherence to the user's preferences, the next food item should be different from rice and account for the remaining items, which are 'broccoli' and 'chicken'. Considering no specific sequence priority was provided, 'broccoli' or 'chicken' can be selected. To maintain a variety, 'broccoli' is selected as it follows a vegetable after a grain, maintaining a balanced dietary consideration.

Next food item as string: 'broccoli'
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user does not have an explicit preference mentioned, so the adjustments for the next bite of food will be based on the default values and bite history. Given the bite history contains only one entry for rice with both parameters set to the default values, there's not much to extrapolate in terms of the user's specific preferences.

Strategy: Since there's only one entry in the bite history with default settings and no explicit preference mentioned for the next bite, which is broccoli, the parameters will be adjusted slightly to accommodate the nature of the food but largely remain oriented around the default or historical values for consistency.

Next distance to mouth: The previous distance was the default at 7.5, indicating no specific preference. Considering broccoli's texture, which is more robust than rice, placing it slightly closer to the mouth may ensure a smoother transition from spoon to mouth without requiring the user to adjust much. This reasoning leans towards a slight adjustment, favoring a more direct approach compared to the lighter, more discrete texture of rice.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.0

Next exit angle: Given that the default angle was satisfactory for rice and that broccoli might hold onto the spoon differently due to its bulkier nature, a minor adjustment to the exit angle can help in providing a comfortable and efficient eating experience. However, with no other data to suggest the user prefers a higher or lower tilt, a minor increase from the default gives a bit more clearance and assists in a cleaner release from the spoon.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers smaller bites for rice and larger bites for other foods.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference for smaller bites of rice and larger for everything else, along with the previous bite history showing a 2.0 bite size for rice and a 6.0 bite size for broccoli, the next bite size should follow these preferences. Given that the most recent food item was broccoli, with a larger bite size, opting for a food item that hasn't been fed recently or aligning with the sequence while adhering to the user's preference for bite size.

Next bite size: Since the last food item consumed was broccoli with a larger bite size, and considering the user's preference, if the next food item chosen is not rice, a larger bite is preferred. But if rice is chosen again, it must be smaller to align with the preference. Looking at the sequence and considering a balance in diet, alternating the food item makes sense, so opting for a food item not recently fed. Given 'chicken' follows the preference for larger bites and hasn't been fed yet, a larger bite similar to the previous non-rice item is suitable.
Next bite size as float: 6.0
Next food item: Since 'chicken' has not been fed yet and considering an alternating approach to ensure a varied diet, it's the logical next choice. It aligns with the preference for larger bites for foods other than rice and follows a sequence where each item is given attention.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user does not have an explicitly stated preference for distance_to_mouth or exit_angle. However, their history of adjustments suggests a slight preference for closer distances and slightly higher exit angles than the default.

Strategy: To decide on the parameters for the next spoonful of chicken, we'll analyze the bite history which shows a trend towards preferring the spoon closer to the mouth and a modest increase in the exit angle. Given that chicken is more substantial than rice but less cumbersome to scoop than broccoli, a moderate adjustment considering past preferences seems appropriate.

Next distance to mouth: Since the previous distances were 7.5 and 7.0, with the latest being slightly closer, it indicates a preference for the spoon to be closer than the default distance but not as close as the most recent choice, likely due to the different texture of chicken compared to rice and broccoli. Slightly increasing the distance from the last value accounts for the need to secure the chicken on the spoon without it being too close.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.2

Next exit angle: The exit angles have slightly increased from the default, moving from 90.0 to 92.0. Given this pattern and considering the nature of chicken, which may require a bit less tilt to stay on the spoon compared to the previous items, setting the exit angle slightly above the last setting can accommodate this need without a significant change.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers smaller bites for rice and larger bites for other types of food.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for smaller bites of rice and larger bites for other foods, and considering the bite history, it's clear that a pattern of adjusting the bite size based on the type of food needs to be followed. As the last food item was chicken with a bite size of 6.0, and considering the need to rotate the food items to maintain variety and follow the sequence to ensure all items are consumed relatively evenly, the next item should be selected based on what was previously fed and the user's preference.

Next bite size: Since the next item to be fed is rice, based on the user's preference for smaller bites of rice, and looking at the bite history where rice was previously given in a smaller bite size of 2.0, a smaller bite size should be chosen again.

Next bite size as float: 2.0

Next food item: Rice should be the next food item as it follows the sequence and preference pattern. The last food item fed was chicken, so to ensure variety and adherence to the user's preference, rice is chosen. It also aligns with the pattern of rotating through the different food items to maintain a balanced diet and variety in the feeding sequence.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user does not have a specified preference, but their past bite parameters show a gradual preference for closer distances and slightly increasing exit angles.

Strategy: Given the absence of explicit preferences, the adjustments are based on the observed trends in the bite history. The previous bites show a tendency towards slightly closer distances and incrementally higher exit angles.

Next distance to mouth: The bite history shows a trend towards closer distances to the mouth, moving from 7.5 to 7.0 and then slightly increasing to 7.2 for chicken. Since rice was previously served at 7.5 and the trend has been generally closer, we'll adjust slightly closer than the last rice setting without going as close as the most recent setting for chicken, aiming for a midpoint between the closest (7.0) and the most recent non-rice (7.2).
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.1

Next exit angle: The exit angles have been increasing gradually, from 90.0 for rice to 93.0 for chicken. Since rice is being served again and the last setting for rice was 90.0, considering the incremental increase observed, a minor adjustment above the last rice setting is advisable, reflecting a slight increase while being mindful of not altering too drastically from the known preferences.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers smaller bites for rice and larger bites for other foods. 

Strategy: Since the preference is for smaller bites for rice and larger for others, the bite_size will be adjusted based on the chosen food item. The next food item will consider the sequence of previously chosen items, aiming for variety and adhering to the user's preference for bite size when applicable. As the last item eaten was rice with a small bite size, we'll select a different food item next, trying to cycle through the available options to ensure variety.

Next bite size:
Given the preference for smaller bites for rice and considering the previous bite sizes for other foods were larger, if the next food item chosen is not rice, the bite size should be larger, similar to past choices for variety. The default large bite size from the history for non-rice items is around 6.0.

Next bite size as float: 6.0
Next food item:
Since the last item consumed was rice and to ensure variety, the next item chosen should be something different from rice. Given the sequence and the remaining portions, a logical choice is broccoli, as it allows for following the user's preference for larger bites with other foods and cycling through the options efficiently.

Next food item as string: 'broccoli'
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference trends towards slightly closer and with a somewhat higher tilt than the defaults. This is inferred from the historical bite parameters, which consistently show a preference for a distance_to_mouth less than the default of 7.5 and an exit_angle slightly above the default of 90.0.

Strategy: I'll choose parameters that closely align with the user's demonstrated preferences, ensuring comfort and ease of feeding. Given the consistency in the historical preferences for both parameters, I'll select values that reflect this trend.

Next distance to mouth: Since the past distances to mouth were all below the default of 7.5, and specifically for broccoli previously it was set to 7.0, it indicates a preference for the spoon to be somewhat closer. To maintain consistency and considering the previous preference for broccoli, I'll match the last broccoli entry.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.0

Next exit angle: The exit angles for previous bites are consistently above the default, indicating a slight preference for a higher tilt. The last angle used for broccoli was 92.0, and given the slight increase over time for the chicken, it seems prudent to slightly adjust upward from the last broccoli value, acknowledging a preference for increasing tilt, particularly for solids.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers smaller bites for rice and larger bites for other foods.

Strategy: Since the user has a specific preference for smaller bites of rice and larger bites for other foods, we'll use the bite history to guide the size of the next bite, especially adhering to the user's preferences. The last item fed was broccoli with a bite size of 6.0. To ensure variety and adhere to the user’s preference for bite sizes, the next item should ideally not be broccoli to maintain a diverse diet in the feeding sequence, and the bite size should adhere to the user's preferences for the specific food chosen.

Next bite size: Since the portions remaining show that there is still rice and chicken to be fed and rice is preferred in smaller bites, if rice is chosen based on the last food item and sequence, a smaller bite size similar to the historical values for rice should be chosen. If chicken is chosen, a larger bite similar to its historical values should be selected. Considering the last food was broccoli, and to ensure variety, choosing chicken next and using a larger bite size akin to its previous value makes sense.

Next bite size as float: 6.0

Next food item: Chicken is the next logical choice following the sequence of feeding, ensuring variety and adhering to the user's preference for larger bites with foods other than rice. Since chicken has not been the most recent food item and there are portions remaining, it supports both variety in diet and the remaining portion needs.

Summary: The user's preference, based on bite history, seems to favor slightly closer and higher tilted spoon approaches. Previous bites tend towards distances slightly less than the default 7.5 and exit angles above the default 90.0.

Strategy: Given the history, the optimal parameters should align with the observed tendencies for a slightly closer distance and a higher tilt than the default values, especially considering the next bite is chicken, which was previously served with specific parameters.

Next distance to mouth: Observing the pattern, all previous distances are closer than the default, with chicken previously having a distance of 7.2. Averaging the distances for chicken and similar foods suggests a preference for a slightly closer approach.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.2

Next exit angle: The past choices for exit angles with chicken and other foods have consistently been above 90.0, indicating a preference for a higher tilt. The previous chicken bite had an exit angle of 93.0, suggesting this is a comfortable angle for such food.

Summary: The user prefers smaller bites for rice and larger bites for other foods.

Strategy: According to the preference and the bite history, for rice, the bites were around 2.0, and for broccoli and chicken, the bites were around 6.0. The last food item served was chicken, suggesting a rotation or alternation in the choice of food items to maintain variety and possibly follow a sequence matching previous behaviors.

Next bite size: Since the next food item in sequence after 'chicken' has been 'rice' and 'broccoli' and considering the user preference for smaller bites for rice, a smaller bite size is chosen for rice based on the history.

Next bite size as float: 2.0

Next food item: Given the rotation in the bite history ('rice' -> 'broccoli' -> 'chicken'), and considering that rice was served two positions back, it fits the sequence to serve 'rice' next respecting the user preference for variety and previous patterns.

Summary: The user's preference seems to favor a slightly closer distance to the mouth and a slightly higher than default exit angle based on the recorded bite history.

Strategy: The strategy involves analyzing the previous recorded bites to determine the user's apparent preference for both distance to mouth and exit angle. As the history shows a trend towards closer distances (all below the default of 7.5) and slightly higher exit angles than the default, the adjustments will lean towards these observed preferences.

Next distance to mouth: The history suggests a consistent preference for a distance closer than the default. The values are all below 7.5, with rice specifically being served at 7.1 most recently. A slight decrease from the default to better match the historical preference seems appropriate.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.1

Next exit angle: The exit angles for previous bites also show a preference for slightly above the default, particularly for rice and broccoli. The most recent angle for rice was at 91.0. Considering all food types, there appears to be a preference for angles slightly above 90.0 but still generally close to that range.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers smaller bites when consuming rice and larger bites for other types of food.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference and the bite history, the choice of the next bite size and food item should respect the specified size preference and aim to rotate through the available food items in a manner that balances variety and adheres to the mentioned portions and efficiency levels.

Next bite size: Given the most recent food item consumed was rice with a bite size of 2.0, and considering the preference for smaller bites for rice and larger bites for other food types, the next bite, if not rice, should be larger to align with the user's preferences. As the last non-rice food item was consumed with a bite size of 6.0, maintaining or slightly adjusting this value for non-rice food would be appropriate.

Next bite size as float: 6.0

Next food item: The last item consumed was rice, following the pattern in the bite history, the next item should be different from the last to ensure variety and adherence to the preference sequence. Since both broccoli and chicken have been consumed in larger bites and it's essential to rotate to maintain variety, the next food should logically follow the sequence, and considering broccoli came before chicken in the history, chicken should be next to maintain the sequence and variety.
