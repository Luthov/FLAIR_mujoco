Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be kept close to their mouth when being offered rice.

Strategy: Given that the user has a specific preference for the spoon to be close to their mouth when feeding rice, this preference will be considered for setting the distance_to_mouth parameter. No specific preferences are provided for bite_size and exit_angle, so defaults will be used unless the context of the food item suggests otherwise. The choice of the next food item will be based on introducing variety while also considering user preferences and the sequence of previously fed items, though no history is provided in this case.

Next bite size: No specific preference has been stated for bite_size, and without prior bite history to suggest a preferred size for rice or any other food, the default value will be maintained to accommodate general comfort and safety.
Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: Since there's no bite history to indicate what was last fed to the user, the choice of the next food item should introduce variety and adhere to user preferences. The preference mentions rice specifically, which combined with the aim for variety among the food items available, makes rice the preferred initial choice as it directly involves the user's stated preference.
Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next distance to mouth: The user has expressed a preference for keeping the spoon close to their mouth specifically when offering rice. This suggests a value closer than the default for the distance_to_mouth parameter. Therefore, choosing a value at the closer end of the scale, while ensuring comfort and safety during feeding, accommodates this preference.
Next distance to mouth as float: 5.0

Next exit angle: There are no specific preferences regarding the tilt or angle of spoon exit. Thus, the default value, which is designed to be generally suitable and comfortable for the user, is maintained. This should ensure a smooth feeding experience without any specific indication that a different angle is required.

Summary: The user's preference is to have the spoon kept close to their mouth when being offered rice.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference for keeping the spoon close while being offered rice, and analyzing the bite history which contains only one entry with rice being served at a distance of 5.0 and exit angle of 90.0 with a bite size of 5.0, it's reasonable to deduce that they may have a similar preference for closeness with other food items. Given there's no specific preference for bite size, the default size from the bite history is adopted. The exit angle of 90.0 from the history is considered optimal since there was no expressed preference for change. For the next food item, it's strategic to rotate to the next item on the list to ensure variety and adherence to user preference sequencing.

Next bite size: Considering there's no specific user preference for bite size mentioned other than the history and aiming to maintain consistency based on previous experience, the default value from the bite history (5.0) is chosen.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The previous food item served was rice. To ensure variety and to follow a sequence that provides the user with a different experience, the next item in the list, beans, is chosen as the next food item, as there's an implicit strategy of rotating through the items to maintain diversity in meals.

Next food item as string: 'beans'

Next distance to mouth: The user has a preference for keeping the spoon closer to their mouth, especially highlighted for rice, which might imply a general comfort with having the spoon closer during feeding. With a previous successful delivery at a 5.0 distance, it's logical to replicate this parameter to meet user comfort levels.

Next distance to mouth as float: 5.0

Next exit angle: There was no specific preference indicated for changing the exit angle. Given the prior usage of an exit angle set at 90.0 degrees and considering there was no expressed dissatisfaction, the same value is reused to ensure consistency in the feeding experience, presuming comfort and efficiency with the prior setting.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The userâ€™s preference suggests keeping the spoon closer to their mouth when offering rice, indicating a desire for a shorter distance to mouth, specifically for rice.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for keeping the spoon closer when offering rice, the next bite's parameters will aim to respect this preference while considering the sequence and type of food being served next.

Next bite size: Since no specific preference for a smaller or larger bite size was mentioned and the bite history shows a consistent bite size of 5.0 for both rice and beans, the default value of 5.0 will be maintained. This choice strikes a balance between not being too small or too large, likely suitable for a wide range of food types including corn, which is next based on variety and rotation.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The last food item fed was beans, and given the sequence of food items (rice, beans, then corn), corn should logically follow to ensure variety and equal consumption of all available food types. Since rice has already been given and preference suggests special consideration for rice, next in line without special instruction defaults to corn.

Next food item as string: 'corn'

Next distance to mouth: Based on the user's preference for keeping the spoon closer to their mouth especially when offering rice, it indicates a general comfort with the spoon being closer. Even though the upcoming item is corn, this preference might suggest the user generally favors a closer spoon distance. Considering this feedback, and to maintain a semblance of consistency with the user's comfort, a value closer than the default 7.5 is chosen but not as close as the preference might suggest for rice. Therefore, a slightly reduced distance to mouth will be applied to accommodate the user's comfort while balancing the default value and the functional reach for feeding corn.

Next distance to mouth as float: 6.5

Next exit angle: There's no specific preference indicated regarding the exit angle, and the bite history shows a consistent value of 90.0 for both rice and beans. Without any indication that a different exit angle would be preferred for corn, it seems prudent to stick with this default value. It ensures a neutral tilt that is likely comfortable and effective for a wide variety of foods.

Summary: The user prefers that the spoon is kept close to their mouth when being offered rice, indicating a possible preference for a closer distance to mouth for comfort or ease of feeding.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference for keeping the spoon closer when offering rice and the bite history, the strategy focuses on ensuring comfort and ease of eating by adjusting the distance to the mouth accordingly. Since the last food item fed was corn, the next food item will follow the sequence in which the user was last fed, maintaining variety and equal portions. Bite size will default to 5.0 in the absence of a specific preference, ensuring consistency with previous meals. The exit angle will also default to 90.0, aiming for a neutral position and taking into account the user's possible comfort and the absence of explicit preferences regarding the spoon's tilt.

Next bite size: Choosing the default value of 5.0 due to no explicit preference for bite size. This aligns with the sizes of previous bites, ensuring consistency.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
Next food item: Following the sequence 'rice', 'beans', then 'corn' from the bite history and considering the last served food was corn, 'rice' should be next for variety and to maintain the sequence.
Next food item as string: 'rice'
Next distance to mouth: The user's preference for keeping the spoon close to their mouth especially when offering rice guides the selection of a value lower than the default, aligning with the preference for proximity. Considering the user was comfortable with a distance to mouth of 5.0 for rice previously, this value is maintained.

Summary:
The user prefers the spoon to be kept close to their mouth when being fed rice, which indicates a preference for a smaller distance to mouth specifically with rice.

Strategy:
Considering the user's preference for keeping the spoon close when offering rice, and observing the bite history to guide the parameters, the aim is to adjust the values to optimize comfort and efficiency based on previous interactions and the given instructions.

Next bite size:
Since there's no explicit preference stated for bite size apart from the default value of 5.0 used previously for rice, and considering the bite size has remained consistent across different foods without specific feedback, we'll maintain this value. It seems to be an adequate, possibly preferred size given no reported issues.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item:
Given the last food item fed was rice and aiming for variety balanced with the portions remaining, the next logical choice would be 'beans' as it's the next item in sequence with the most portions left. This alternates food items ensuring variety and addresses portion management.

Next food item as string: 'beans'

Next distance to mouth:
Reflecting the user's preference for keeping the spoon closer when offered rice, and given the last recorded distance for rice was 5.0, indicating satisfaction, a closer distance to mouth is preferred for rice. However, since the next item is 'beans,' and no specific preference for beans is mentioned, but aiming for comfort, a default or slightly user-preferred closer setting influenced by previous successful feedings seems reasonable. Considering rice and beans might have similar handling characteristics but also to slightly adjust for user comfort based on overall feedback, a small adjustment closer than the default might be optimal.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.0

Next exit angle:
No specific preference regarding exit angle has been stated, and since all previous angles were maintained at 90.0 across different foods without indications of discomfort or inefficiency, itâ€™s logical to keep this setting. It appears to be satisfactory and possibly optimal for spoon withdrawal without reported issues.

Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be kept close to their mouth when offering rice.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference for keeping the spoon close to their mouth while being fed rice, and analyzing the bite history for patterns or deviations in parameters, the decision on the adjustable parameters has been made as follows:

Next bite size: The bite history shows a consistent bite size of 5.0 for all items, including rice and others. Given no specific preference for bite size alteration, we will maintain this default value.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The bite history suggests a rotation among the available food items without repetition until each has been served at least once since the last serving of the same item. The last item served was beans. Given the items remaining are ['rice', 'beans', 'corn'] with portions left and considering the last served item, the next logical choice based on rotation and portions would be 'corn', as it has not been the most recently served item and has sufficient portions remaining.

Next food item as string: 'corn'

Next distance to mouth: Given the user's specific request to keep the spoon close to their mouth when offering rice, and considering the 'corn' is being served next (without a stated preference), we reference the closest prior distance used for corn which is 6.5. However, because the explicit preference mentions "close" for rice and may not directly apply to corn, we should consider if any adjustments are necessary. Since no specific distance preference for 'corn' is provided, we'll maintain a distance similar to the last 'corn' service for consistency, recognizing the user's general preference for closeness without overriding it for specifics not provided.

Next distance to mouth as float: 6.5

Next exit angle: There are no specific preferences stated or implied regarding the exit angle from the user's history or direct request. The exit angle has consistently been 90.0 across all bites regardless of the food type. Therefore, we follow this established pattern and select the default exit angle to maintain the user's comfort and ensure consistency.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be kept close to their mouth when offering food, specifically noted for rice.

Strategy: The preference for keeping the spoon close to the mouth when feeding, especially noted for rice, influences the distance to mouth parameter the most. Given the rotation of food items in the bite history and ensuring variety, the next food item should follow the sequence observed. Since rice was fed after corn in the bite history, it suggests following this sequence. Bite size and exit angle are set based on defaults and observations from the bite history unless specified by user preferences.

Next bite size: There's no specific preference mentioned for making the bite size larger or smaller for the next bite, and the bite history shows a consistency in using a bite size of 5.0. Hence, we will stick to this default value as it seems to have worked well so far.
Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The last food item fed was corn, and considering the sequence followed in the bite history, each food item is being alternated in order. Therefore, the sequence suggests that after corn, rice should be the next food item as it follows this pattern previously observed.
Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next distance to mouth: Since the user has a preference for keeping the spoon close to their mouth, especially noted with rice, and the bite history shows distances as low as 5.0 for feeding rice successfully, it's prudent to choose a value that aligns with this preference for the next feeding.
Next distance to mouth as float: 5.0

Next exit angle: There hasn't been a specific preference stated for changing the exit angle from the default 90.0, and the bite history indicates that an exit angle of 90.0 has been consistently used. Without explicit preference to alter this, we will maintain it.

Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be close to their mouth when being offered rice.

Strategy: Given the preference for the spoon to be close to the mouth specifically for rice and analyzing the bite history for cues on size, distance, and angle preferences for all foods provided, the adjustments are made to align with these specifications while also ensuring variety in the food items selected.

Next bite size: Since there is no specific preference mentioned for bite size other than the default size observed in the bite history, which consistently shows a size of 5.0 for various food items, we'll maintain this default value for consistency and safety.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: Looking at the bite history, the pattern alternates among rice, beans, and corn. The last item eaten was rice; therefore, following the pattern, the next item should logically be beans to keep a balanced diet and variety in the feeding sequence.

Next food item as string: 'beans'

Next distance to mouth: The user's preference states keeping the spoon close when offering rice, which has been implemented at a distance of 5.0 based on bite history. Although the preference specifically mentions rice, it shows a user comfort with a closer spoon distance overall. Given that the last distance for beans was 7.0, slightly closer than the default but not as close as for rice, adapting with a marginally closer measurement for comfort based on preference indication and history seems sensible, thus choosing a slightly closer distance while respecting the specific preference for rice.

Next distance to mouth as float: 6.5

Next exit angle: There's no specific preference mentioned for exit angle in the user's preferences or discernible pattern in the bite history that deviates from the default 90.0 degrees. Consequently, maintaining the default angle ensures consistency with the user's apparent comfort and previous experience.

Summary: The user's preference indicates a desire to have the spoon close to their mouth when being fed rice.

Strategy: Analyzing the user's preference alongside their bite history, the focus will be on maintaining a consistent approach towards feeding that matches the historical data and respects the stated preference for spoon proximity when offering rice.

Next bite size: Given no specific preference mentioned for bite size and observing that the bite history consistently shows a size of 5.0 for various food items, it's reasonable to maintain this bite size. It appears to be a comfortable amount for the user.
Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: Considering the last food item fed was 'beans' and observing the user's sequence and preference, the rotation suggests 'rice' should be next. This choice also aligns with the mentioned preference of keeping the spoon close to the mouth, which has been specifically requested for rice.
Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next distance to mouth: The preference clearly states the spoon should be kept close to the mouth when offering rice, similar to the previous instances where rice was given at a distance of 5.0. This value will be used again to match the user's comfort and preference.
Next distance to mouth as float: 5.0

Next exit angle: There is no specified preference for the exit angle, and the bite history for all items, including rice, consistently shows an angle of 90.0 degrees. To ensure consistency and given no expressed desire for a different tilt, the previous standard angle seems most appropriate.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be kept close to their mouth when offering rice. This indicates a preference for a shorter distance to the mouth specifically for rice. 

Strategy: To decide on the appropriate bite size, next food item, distance to mouth, and exit angle, the user's preferences and previous bite history are considered. The user's explicit preference for closeness when feeding rice informs the distance to mouth parameter. The bite history provides insight into the patterns or preferences in bite size and exit angle, which, absent any explicit preferences, should guide the default choices.

Next bite size: Given that there is no explicit preference for bite size and the bite history consistently shows a size of 5.0 for various food items, the default of 5.0 is selected for the next bite size. This consistency suggests it is a comfortable size for the user. 

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The strategy for choosing the next food item involves considering the user's previous consumption and the available portions. The most recent bite was rice, following a pattern where rice and beans are alternated, with corn after beans before returning to rice. Given that portions of beans and corn remain with portion counts [0, 1, 1], beans should logically be the next choice to maintain variation and because rice's portion is finished.

Next food item as string: 'beans'

Next distance to mouth: Since the user prefers the spoon to be kept close to their mouth specifically when offering rice, and the next food item is beans for which no specific distance preference is noted, the default value is used. The previously noted preferences and actions suggest a variable approach based on the food item, wherein the absence of specificity for beans, 7.5 is the ideal choice, ensuring comfort and efficiency.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The exit angle in the bite history is consistently at 90.0 for different food items, including both rice and beans. There's no stated preference suggesting a departure from this value; therefore, following the pattern in the bite history, 90.0 is chosen as it seems to have been satisfactory and comfortable for the user.
