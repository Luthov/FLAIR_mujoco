[]
=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and broccoli, specifically requesting smaller bites of chicken than usual. There are no specific preferences mentioned for bite size of broccoli or other parameters (distance to mouth or exit angle).

Strategy: Given the preference for smaller chicken bites and alternating between chicken and broccoli, the next food item will be chosen based on alternation, starting with chicken as it's mentioned first. Since there is a preference for smaller chicken bites, the bite size for chicken will be smaller than the default. Default values will be used for distance to mouth and exit angle due to lack of specific instructions.

Next bite size: Since the user requests smaller bites for chicken specifically, and the default is 5.0, selecting a value slightly below this default seems appropriate to honor the request for a smaller bite size.
Next bite size as float: 4.0

Next food item: Assuming there's no history of previous bites (as indicated by the empty bite history list), the first bite will start with chicken, following the alternation preference stated by the user.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next distance to mouth: Without specific user preferences regarding the distance to the mouth and in the absence of prior history to draw from, sticking with the default value is justified.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Similar to the distance to mouth, no preference has been indicated for the exit angle, and there is no bite history to suggest an adjustment. Therefore, using the default value is reasonable.
Next exit angle as float: 90.0

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and broccoli, specifically requesting smaller bites of chicken compared to other foods. There is no explicit preference stated about mashed potatoes, distance to mouth, or exit angle, implying standard settings for these parameters might be suitable unless prior bite history suggests otherwise.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for smaller chicken pieces, the last bite was chicken with specific parameters. Following the alternating preference, the next food item should be broccoli. The absence of a specific preference for broccoli bite size allows us to use the default or to adjust based on prior history and applied logic. As the previous bite size for chicken was adjusted to be smaller (4.0) than the default (5.0), and since the user did not specify smaller bites for broccoli, the default size could be appropriate for broccoli. Distance to mouth and exit angle will refer to the defaults or follow the last bite parameters in absence of explicit preferences.

Next bite size: Since the user’s preference was for smaller chicken bites and didn't specify for broccoli, the default bite size is chosen for broccoli for a balanced approach.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
Next food item: The last bite was chicken, and to follow the alternating preference between chicken and broccoli, the next item should be broccoli.
Next food item as string: 'broccoli'
Next distance to mouth: No specific preference was stated, and the last recorded distance was 7.5, which is the default; thus, we stick to this value for consistency.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: No specific preference for exit angle was mentioned, following the last recorded value which aligns with the default setting of 90.0.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and broccoli, specifically requesting smaller bites of chicken compared to broccoli or any other food. There is no specific preference mentioned for distance to mouth or exit angle, suggesting that the default or historical values can be used for those parameters.

Strategy: To adhere to the user's preferences, we observe the pattern of alternating bites from the bite history and the explicit preference for smaller chicken bites. The default values will be used for distance to mouth and exit angle unless a preference was indicated, which in this case, it was not.

Next bite size: Based on the user's preference for smaller bites of chicken and since the last item was broccoli with a bite size of 5.0, and assuming the sequence is to alternate without reducing broccoli's size, we'll choose a slightly smaller size for the next chicken bite compared to its last size of 4.0 to maintain the "smaller bites" preference. Given that the previous chicken bite was 4.0 and there's no indication that it was too large or too small, we will maintain this size to ensure consistency with the user's preferences.
Next bite size as float: 4.0

Next food item: Given the alternating pattern of chicken and broccoli from the bite history and the user's preference, the next food item should logically be chicken, following broccoli.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next distance to mouth: There's no specific preference mentioned for this parameter. Therefore, we will use the default value or the value from the bite history, which consistently has been 7.5 for the previous bites.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: No specific preference was indicated for the exit angle, so we'll continue with the value used in the previous bites, adhering to the consistency observed in the bite history, which is 90.0.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and broccoli, with smaller bites of chicken compared to the default size.

Strategy: Given the user’s preference for alternating bites of chicken and broccoli and the desire for smaller chicken bites, we will adjust the parameters accordingly, being mindful of the previous bite sizes and items from the bite history.

Next bite size: Since the user prefers smaller bites of chicken and the last chicken bite was a size 4.0, we will maintain this preference for chicken bite sizes. However, since the next item should be broccoli (based on the alternating preference), we will use the default size of 5.0 for broccoli, as no specific preference for broccoli bite size was given.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The bite history shows an alternating pattern of chicken and broccoli, with the most recent bite being chicken. Following the user’s preference, the next food item should be broccoli.

Next food item as string: 'broccoli'

Next distance to mouth: There are no specific user preferences regarding the distance to mouth, so we will use the default value which was also used in the previous bites, as indicated by the bite history.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Since there was no specific preference mentioned for the exit angle and the bite history consistently shows an angle of 90.0, we will continue to use this value for the next bite.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and broccoli, with smaller bites of chicken compared to other foods.
Strategy: Based on the preference for smaller chicken bites, the chicken bite sizes in the history were 4.0, thus adopting this value again for consistency. Given the alternating pattern, and since the last item served was broccoli, the next item should be chicken to maintain the sequence. There are no specific preferences mentioned for distance_to_mouth and exit_angle, so the default values from the history, which seem to satisfy the user so far, will be used.
Next bite size: The user prefers smaller bites of chicken, and the history suggests that smaller chicken bites were previously sized at 4.0.
Next bite size as float: 4.0
Next food item: The last food item served was broccoli, and the user’s preference is to alternate between chicken and broccoli. Since mashed potatoes weren't mentioned in the preference, continue alternating as per the initial request.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
Next distance to mouth: There's no specific preference indicated for this parameter; thus, the historical value of 7.5, which seemed acceptable in previous instances, will be used.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: No specific preference for exit angle was mentioned, so the default value from the history, 90.0, will be continued as it has been satisfactory.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and broccoli, specifically requesting smaller bites of chicken compared to other food items.

Strategy: To adhere to the user's preference for alternating bites of chicken and broccoli with smaller bites of chicken, the bite history is crucial. Given the pattern and the last item fed was chicken, the next item should be broccoli. The user's preference for smaller chicken bites has been consistently applied with a bite size of 4.0 for chicken but defaults to 5.0 for broccoli as per the bite history; no specific preference for broccoli bite size is mentioned. Distance to mouth and exit angle have averaged 7.5 and 90.0, respectively, with no request for adjustment, so we will maintain these as they appear suitable and consistent with history.

Next bite size: Since the user has not specified a preference for smaller or larger bites of broccoli, and the previous broccoli bites were served at a default size of 5.0, we will continue with this size, noticing that it fits within the normal range and adheres to past behavior.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
Next food item: Following the pattern of alternating between chicken and broccoli, and considering that the last item served was chicken, the next item should logically be broccoli.
Next food item as string: 'broccoli'
Next distance to mouth: There has been no specific user preference indicated for changing the distance from the default 7.5, and this value has been consistent across all previous feedings without issue.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: Since there were no preferences or previous adjustments mentioned for the exit angle, and it has remained steady at 90.0 across various feedings, it is reasonable to continue with this angle to maintain consistency and comfort.
Next exit angle as float: 90.0

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user’s preference involves alternating bites of chicken and broccoli, with an emphasis on smaller bites of chicken compared to broccoli. There has not been any specific mention of preferences towards distance to mouth or exit angle, hence previous values will guide these decisions.

Strategy: Following the user's preference and the sequence of previous bites, the strategy would involve alternating between chicken and broccoli, while keeping chicken bites smaller than broccoli based on the bite history and the remaining items. Given there's no specific mention of distance to mouth or exit angle preferences, the last known preferences (7.5 for distance and 90.0 for exit angle) will be applied.

Next bite size: The last food item served was broccoli with a bite size of 5.0, and since the user prefers smaller bites of chicken and the last chicken bite was 4.0, maintaining this size aligns with their preference.
Next bite size as float: 4.0

Next food item: Given the alternating sequence and the last item served being broccoli, the next item to serve should be chicken to keep up with the alternating pattern.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next distance to mouth: There hasn't been any specific preference stated for the distance to mouth since all previous values are 7.5, maintaining this value adheres to the inferred preference.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Without any particular preference expressed for the exit angle, and considering all prior values have been at 90.0, this value will be maintained to adhere to the consistency observed in past servings.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user’s preference involves alternating between bites of chicken and broccoli, with chicken bites being smaller than the default size.

Strategy: To comply with the user's preference for alternating food items and specific size requests for chicken bites, the last bite given was of broccoli suggesting chicken should be next. The bite size for chicken based on historical preferences indicates smaller bites were provided, around 4.0. The distance to mouth and exit angle will default to the historical values since there's no specific preference indicating a deviation from these values.

Next bite size: Since the user prefers smaller bites of chicken and history shows a consistent size of 4.0 for chicken, this size will be maintained.
Next bite size as float: 4.0

Next food item: Given the alternating preference between chicken and broccoli, and considering the last food item was broccoli, the next should be chicken, especially since there's still a portion left of chicken.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next distance to mouth: There’s no specific request for adjusting the distance to the mouth; thus, the default historical value of 7.5 will be used, reflecting a balance between comfort and practicality.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: No specific preference towards the exit angle has been expressed, so following the historical data seems reasonable. The consistent choice has been a 90.0 angle, which likely suits various foods well.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and broccoli, with smaller bites for chicken compared to the default bite size.

Strategy: Since the last food item served was chicken and the user prefers alternating between chicken and broccoli, the next food item will be broccoli. Given the preference for smaller bites of chicken and no specific preference mentioned for the size of broccoli bites, we will use the last served size for broccoli as a reference for the next bite size. No specific preferences regarding distance to mouth or exit angle were mentioned, so we'll default to the values used previously for broccoli.

Next bite size: Since the last broccoli bite was 5.0, and there's no specification for broccoli to be served in smaller or larger sizes (only chicken was mentioned to be served in smaller bites), we'll maintain the same bite size for consistency.
Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The last item served was chicken, and given the preference for alternating bites between chicken and broccoli, the next item should be broccoli.
Next food item as string: 'broccoli'

Next distance to mouth: No specific preference regarding the distance to the mouth was mentioned. Previously served broccoli bites have consistently maintained a distance of 7.5, which seems to be acceptable.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Similarly, no specific preference for the exit angle was mentioned. Previous broccoli bites have used an exit angle of 90.0, which we will continue to use for consistency.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and broccoli, with smaller bites of chicken compared to the default size, and no specific preferences were mentioned for distance to mouth or exit angle.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for smaller chicken bites and alternating between chicken and broccoli, we'll adjust the bite size for chicken accordingly while keeping the default parameters for distance to mouth and exit angle, due to the lack of specific preferences in those areas. Since 'chicken' was the last food item fed and considering the alternating preference, the next food item should be 'broccoli'.

Next bite size: Since the last chicken bite was smaller than the default, and the user prefers smaller bites of chicken, but the next item is broccoli, we'll use the default size for broccoli as no size preference for broccoli was mentioned, and the prior broccoli bites were at the default bite size.
Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: Given the alternating pattern in the user's preference and the last item being ‘chicken’, the next food item should be 'broccoli' to maintain the alternation.
Next food item as string: 'broccoli'

Next distance to mouth: There were no details provided on distance to mouth preferences, thus we will maintain the default value used in previous bites, considering it satisfies the general user requirements.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
