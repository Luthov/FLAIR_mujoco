=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user expresses a preference for starting with the chicken and requests a higher tilt during the feeding process.

Strategy: Given the preferences for the chicken and a higher tilt, we can clearly select 'chicken' as the next food item and increase the exit angle above the default. There is no indicated preference for bite size or distance to mouth, so we will use the default values for these parameters.

Next bite size: Since there's no specific preference for bite size, we'll stick with the default value to ensure comfort and safety.
Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The user's preference is clear; they want to eat the chicken first. Since the preference directly states this and there's a portion available, 'chicken' is the next food item.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next distance to mouth: Without a direct preference towards the distance to the mouth, we'll use the default distance to maintain a comfortable experience for the user.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The user's request for a "higher tilt" when being fed suggests increasing the exit angle above the default to aid in easier feeding. Therefore, selecting a value above 90.0 but ensuring it is not too steep for comfort is crucial.
Next exit angle as float: 100.0

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to eat the chicken first and wants the spoon tilted higher when being fed.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference for eating chicken first and the request for a higher tilt during feeding, the next bite parameters should align closely with these preferences, alongside the historical data available from previous bites.

Next bite size: Given there's no explicit preference for bite size in the user's statement and the previous bite size for chicken was 5.0, we will maintain this default bite size for consistency and to ensure comfort for the user.
Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The user has expressed a preference for eating the chicken first. Given that the history shows chicken has already been served once and assuming a variety in the meal is beneficial for a balanced diet, we'll still choose chicken to honor the user's specified preference. Afterward, assuming variety is desirable, other items would be considered.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next distance to mouth: There were no specific preferences for the distance to mouth provided by the user, and the last recorded distance was 7.5, which is also the default value. Thus, maintaining this distance would be appropriate as it likely reflects a comfortable reach for the user.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The user requested a higher tilt when being fed. Considering the last exit angle was 100.0, which is already above the default of 90.0 and signifies a higher tilt, it is aligned with the user's preference. To further accommodate the user's preference for an even higher tilt within the safety and comfort parameters, we might slightly increase it.
Next exit angle as float: 105.0

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to eat the chicken first and wishes for the spoon to be tilted higher when being fed.

Strategy: Considering the user's preferences and the history of the bite parameters, the strategy is to adjust the parameters to optimize the feeding experience. The preference indicates continuing with chicken and a higher tilt. No specific preference for bite size and distance to mouth is stated, so these will be inferred from the history and default values.

Next bite size: Since there is no specific preference about the size of the bite and the previous sizes for chicken were both 5.0, maintaining this size seems appropriate for consistency. 
Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The user specifically requested to eat the chicken first. Given that the portions remaining list indicates there is still a portion of chicken left and the prior food item being chicken, it conforms to the user's preference to continue with this item.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next distance to mouth: There's no expressed preference for the distance to the mouth. Hence, sticking to the default distance seems reasonable, especially since the distance used in prior chicken bites was 7.5, aligning with the default.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The user prefers a higher tilt. Taking into account that the most recent bites had exit angles of 100.0 and 105.0, slightly increasing the angle beyond the last used value respects the user's preference for a higher tilt while considering what was comfortable previously.
Next exit angle as float: 110.0

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to eat chicken first and wants the spoon tilted higher when being fed.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for eating chicken first and the request for a higher tilt, the parameters will be adjusted accordingly. The bite size will default to 5.0, as there is no specific preference stated regarding the size. Since chicken is the preferred first item and looking at the bite history where the chicken was previously fed, the next food item will continue to be chicken to respect the user’s initial preference and to finish the portion of chicken before moving on to other food items. For the distance to mouth, the default value of 7.5 will be used since no specific preference was stated. However, considering the user’s request for a higher tilt, the exit angle will be adjusted to be higher than the most recent value in the bite history, which was 110.0.

Next bite size: No specific preference for bite size was stated, and considering the past values did not specifically evolve, the default value of 5.0 will be maintained to ensure consistency and comfort for the user.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
Next food item: The user specified wanting to eat the chicken first. The bite history indicates that chicken has been consistently chosen, aligning with respecting the user’s preference for the next food item.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
Next distance to mouth: No specific preference was given for the distance to the mouth; thus, the default value of 7.5 will be used, ensuring a comfortable reach based on previous interactions and lack of specific feedback to adjust this parameter.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: With a clear preference for a higher tilt when being fed and observing an increasing trend in the exit angle from the bite history (100.0, 105.0, 110.0), it is logical to suggest an angle slightly higher than the most recent to cater to the user’s request. An incrementally higher tilt might improve the feeding experience based on the expressed preference.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to eat chicken first and requests a higher tilt when being fed.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference for chicken and a higher tilt angle for the spoon when being fed, the parameters are chosen accordingly. Since chicken was previously chosen, and the preference explicitly mentions chicken, it is the next food item. The exit angle choice is influenced by the preference for a higher tilt, and the bite history indicating a gradual increase in the exit angle with each chicken serving suggests continuing this pattern.

Next bite size: Since there is no specific preference mentioned for the bite size, and the bite history consistently shows a size of 5.0, we'll maintain this default value.
Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The user specifically mentioned wanting to eat the chicken first, and while the portions remaining for chicken are now 0 (given it's not listed in the portions remaining), the implicit instruction suggests prioritizing it. However, since chicken is no longer available based on portions remaining, we default to the next preference or availability, trying to respect the user's food sequence. Given the absence of further preference direction, and with chicken potentially exhausted, we move to the next available item on the list in sequence, which would be rice.
Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next distance to mouth: No specific preference towards distance to the mouth has been mentioned. Therefore, we will maintain the default value that has been previously used and appears to be acceptable, as indicated by repeat usage in bite history.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The user requested that the spoon be tilted higher when feeding. Observing the increasing trend in exit angle in the bite history (100.0 to 115.0 in increments of 5.0) for chicken, and contextually including the preference for a higher tilt, it's reasonable to increase the exit angle further from the last used angle to accommodate the user's preference.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user’s preference indicates a desire to eat chicken first, accompanied by a preference for a higher spoon tilt during feeding.

Strategy: Given the user's preferences and the bite history, decisions aim to match these while ensuring an appropriate continuation of the feeding sequence.

Next bite size: Since no specific preference about bite size was stated and the bite history consistently shows a size of 5.0 for all food items, we will stick to this default size for continuity and lack of contrary preference.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The preference explicitly states a desire to eat the chicken first. Given all the chicken has been served according to the bite history and portions remaining, and the last item fed was rice, the natural progression given no further specific preference would be to move on to the next item in the list. Therefore, carrots become the next choice.

Next food item as string: 'carrots'

Next distance to mouth: No specific preference was stated for the distance to mouth. The bite history consistently shows a distance of 7.5, indicating this distance has been suitable and without stated preference for change, we will continue with this distance.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The user has expressed a preference for a higher tilt when being fed. The bite history shows a progressive increase in exit angle with each subsequent feeding of chicken, culminating at 115.0, and then 120.0 for rice, the highest possible value within the adjustable range. To continue aligning with the user's preference for a higher tilt and considering the last value used, we will maintain the highest possible tilt.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has expressed a preference for eating the chicken first and desires the spoon to be tilted higher for feeding.

Strategy: Based on the user's preferences and the bite history, we will determine the next parameters for the bite acquisition primitive. Since all chicken portions have been consumed (as inferred from the bite history and portions remaining), we'll evaluate the remaining items (rice and carrots) and user's tilt preference to decide the parameters.

Next bite size: Given there is no specific preference towards bite size and considering the consistency in the previous bites, we will default to the standard 5.0 as it fits the general suitability for a user.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The user's initial preference was for chicken, which has now all been served according to the portions remaining. Given the sequential serving nature and no specified preference for either of the remaining foods (rice, carrots), we shall proceed with rice as the next food item since it follows the sequence in which food items were first introduced in the bite history.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next distance to mouth: Since there's no explicit preference regarding the distance to the mouth and to maintain consistency with the previous settings which the user has already experienced, we will keep it at the default value used previously, 7.5. This value seems to have been consistent and presumably comfortable for the user as there's been no request for change.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The user has expressed a preference for a higher tilt when feeding. Given the last two feeding actions ended with an exit angle of 120.0, which corresponds to the higher end of the specified range and aligns with the user’s request for a higher tilt, we will continue with this exit angle as it matches the user's last known preference.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user wants to eat the chicken first and prefers the spoon to be tilted higher when being fed.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference for starting with chicken and higher tilt, along with the latest bite history showing a progression towards higher exit angles reaching up to 120.0, similar strategies will be applied. There's no mentioned preference for bite size and distance to mouth, so these will be based on the default values or adjusted according to similarity with successful previous instances.

Next bite size: Since there's no specific preference mentioned for bite size and considering the consistency in the bite history (all having a value of 5.0), we will maintain this size to ensure comfort and consistency for the user. 
Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: Given the remaining items and their portions are {'chicken', 'rice', 'carrots'} with corresponding portions [0, 1, 2], and considering the user's preference to eat chicken first—since chicken is no longer available due to its absence in the portions list (interpreted from the provided data as having 0 portion left)—we move to the next available item, which by default order after considering the user preference would now be 'rice' since it has not been finished according to bite history and portions remaining list.
Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next distance to mouth: No specific preference has been mentioned about the distance to the mouth. The bite history shows a consistency with a 7.5 distance for all previous instances. Given the lack of direct preference and to maintain a comfortable, consistent experience for the user, we will use this default value.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The user has expressed a desire for a higher tilt when being fed. The bite history shows an increasing trend in tilt angles, culminating at 120.0 degrees for the last three bites (rice and carrots). To align with the user's preference for a higher tilt and considering the recent history, maintaining this maximum documented tilt angle appears appropriate and within the desired preference.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to eat the chicken first and wants the spoon tilted higher when being fed.

Strategy: Given the user's clear preference for chicken and a higher tilt during feeding, the focus will be on selecting parameters that align with these preferences while also considering the historical data provided. Since all the chicken has likely been consumed based on the bite history and portions remaining, the next priority is to choose from the available items considering both user preference for high tilt and no specific request for bite size or distance to mouth.

Next bite size: There's no specific user preference regarding bite size, and historical bite sizes have consistently been 5.0. Thus, maintaining this default value is reasonable due to the lack of explicit instructions to adjust it.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: With all chicken likely consumed based on portions remaining ([0,1,2]) and bite history, and given no specific next preference from the user, the logical choice is to move to the next available item, which is rice, followed by carrots, based on the items remaining.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next distance to mouth: There is no specific user preference mentioned about the feeding distance, and the default in previous feeds was consistently maintained at 7.5. Therefore, continuing with this default value makes the most sense in the absence of specific instructions to alter it.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The user has expressed a preference for a higher tilt when being fed. The recent bite history indicates a gradual increase in exit angle, reaching up to 120.0, which is the highest in the adjustable range and aligns with the user's request for "higher tilt." Thus, maintaining this maximal value complies with the user's expressed preference.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference involves eating the chicken first and having the spoon tilted higher when being fed.

Strategy: Since all the chicken has been eaten (according to portions remaining), and the user's preference was to eat the chicken first, which has already been accommodated, the next food item should be chosen based on the sequence of the remaining foods. Additionally, since the user requested a higher tilt, the exit angle should be adjusted accordingly.

Next bite size: There is no specific preference stated for the bite size, and the bite history shows consistent use of a bite size value of 5.0. Therefore, we will maintain this bite size.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: Given the sequence in the bite history and the portions remaining, carrots are the only food left to be consumed. The most recent food items fed were 'rice' and then 'carrots', and since there is no rice left (portions remaining are 0 for rice and chicken), we will proceed with 'carrots'.

Next food item as string: 'carrots'

Next distance to mouth: No specific preference was indicated for the distance to mouth; the history consistently shows a distance of 7.5. Without any user preference indicating a change, we will continue to use this default value.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: The user's preference was to have the spoon tilted higher when feeding. Looking at the bite history, the exit angle has been gradually increasing, with the last few values at the upper limit of 120.0. Since the user prefers a "higher" tilt and previous settings have moved towards that direction, it makes sense to continue with this preference.
