Summary: The user prefers smaller bites for rice and larger bites for other types of food.

Strategy: Given the preference for smaller bites for rice and larger bites for other foods, the bite size will be adjusted based on the selected food item. Since there's no prior bite history, the default values or adjustments based on the food type will be used for distance to mouth and exit angle. The choice of the next food item will take into account the variety, aiming to alternate food types when possible to maintain an engaging meal experience.

Next bite size: For rice, the user prefers smaller bites, so a value smaller than the default 5.0 is selected. For other food items, a larger bite is preferred, suggesting a value might be closer to 10.0 when not serving rice.
Next bite size as float: 3.0

Next food item: Without a specified sequence and considering the user's preference for smaller bites for rice specifically, starting with rice would adhere to the immediate preference. Furthermore, there's no bite history, so the choice aims to balance the meal experience from the beginning.
Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next distance to mouth: There is no specific preference stated for the distance to the mouth, and no bite history to suggest a user's comfort with previous settings. Therefore, the default value of 7.5 is selected as a balanced choice that should be generally comfortable.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Without specific instructions for the exit angle and no bite history to infer a preference, the default value of 90.0 degrees is used, which is likely a comfortable middle ground for rice consumption.

Summary: The user prefers smaller bites for rice but larger bites for all other food items.

Strategy: Following the user's preference for bite size and considering the history of previous bites, along with providing variation in the food sequence to maintain interest and satisfaction during the meal.

Next bite size: Since the last bite was rice with a size of 3.0 and the user prefers larger bites for food other than rice, I'll choose a larger bite size for the next food item, which is not rice, to enhance satisfaction.
Next bite size as float: 7.0

Next food item: The last bite was rice, and to ensure variety and follow the user’s indirect preference for variety by not repeating the same food consecutively if possible, the next food item chosen is broccoli, which also factors in keeping a balance in serving different types of food items.
Next food item as string: 'broccoli'

Next distance to mouth: There's no specific preference stated for the distance to the mouth other than the default and historical values. Given the absence of specific instructions and to maintain consistency with the previous experience, I'll use the default value since it seems to suit the user fine.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: With no direct preference expressed for the exit angle and the default value from the previous bite seeming adequate, I'm inclined to keep it the same to ensure the consistency of the user experience, considering their comfort and ease of feeding.

Summary: The user prefers smaller bites for rice and larger bites for other food items.

Strategy: Based on the user's preferences and the history of previous bites, we'll adjust the parameters for bite_size, next_food_item, distance_to_mouth, and exit_angle. The preference for bite size is specified for rice. The bite history shows a tendency to adapt bite size based on the type of food. For rice, a smaller bite was taken (3.0), and for broccoli, a larger bite was taken (7.0). Since the last food item fed was broccoli, and considering the sequence and preference, the next logical choice would be to move to the next food item in the list that has not been fed yet, which is chicken, assuming a rotation to ensure variety and adherence to the sequence and preference of the user.

Next bite size: Since the user prefers larger bites for food items other than rice, and considering that the next food item is chicken, a food item for which no specific preference was stated, we'll choose a bite size larger than the default but aligned with the previous larger bite for broccoli. This takes into account the user's preference for larger bites for food items other than rice.

Next bite size as float: 7.0

Next food item: Since the last item fed was broccoli, and to ensure a variety and adherence to the user's sequence of food items, the next food item should be something other than broccoli and rice, the latter of which was already fed earlier. ‘Chicken’ is the next logical choice, as it also allows for a bigger bite, aligning with the user's preferences for larger bites for food items other than rice.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next distance to mouth: Considering there's no specific preference stated by the user concerning the distance to the mouth and aiming for comfort and efficiency, the default and historical value of 7.5 is chosen. The previous bites did not indicate any alteration or issue with this distance, making it suitable for continuing use.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: There's no specific preference stated concerning the exit angle for lifting food to the mouth. Based on previous bites, the exit angle was maintained at 90.0, which likely provides a balance between ensuring the food is properly oriented for easy eating and managing spill risks. There's no presented need to deviate from this established preference.

Summary: The user prefers smaller bites for rice and bigger bites for other foods.

Strategy: To decide on the parameters, I'll follow the user's preference for bite sizes, considering 'smaller' for rice and 'larger' for other items, and look at the history to maintain consistency. Since the last food item was chicken with a bite size of 7.0, distance to mouth 7.5, and exit angle 90.0, and to ensure a varied diet, rotating the food item is wise. Distance to mouth and exit angle preferences aren't specified, so I'll stick to previous values for consistency.

Next bite size: The user prefers smaller bites for rice, but since the last food item was chicken (which correlates with a preference for larger bites for items other than rice) and looking at the history where rice was given a bite size of 3.0, for variety and following the listed preference, it's time for broccoli with a larger bite, similar to the previous non-rice item, which was given a 7.0 bite size.
Next bite size as float: 7.0

Next food item: Since chicken was the last item and considering a rotation to ensure no repetition and aligned with the portions remaining, the next item should logically be broccoli as it's different from the last fed item and aligns with the preference of larger bites for non-rice items.
Next food item as string: 'broccoli'

Next distance to mouth: No specific preference is stated for the distance to the mouth; thus, maintaining consistency with the previous value makes sense for comfort and efficiency.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: No specific preference was mentioned for tilt adjustment, so using the historical default of 90.0 degrees ensures consistency with the user's previous successful feeding experiences.

Summary: The user's preference is for smaller bites when eating rice and larger bites for other food items.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference and the bite history, I will choose parameters that ensure smaller bites for rice and larger bites for other items, while considering the sequence of previously fed items to determine the next food item. The default values for distance to the mouth and exit angle will be adjusted according to previous values used for similar food items if there are any specific patterns; otherwise, the default values will be used.

Next bite size: Since 'broccoli' was the last item fed and considering the user's preference for larger bites for items other than rice, along with the portions remaining and the preference for variety, the next item should ideally be 'chicken', for which larger bites have been previously preferred based on bite history. Therefore, we will choose a larger bite size similar to past non-rice items.

Next bite size as float: 7.0

Next food item: Given that 'broccoli' was the last item fed and following a sequence that ensures variety, 'chicken' should be the next item. It is also in line with the portions remaining and ensures that all types of food are being fed alternately.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next distance to mouth: There are no specific user preferences mentioned for the distance to the mouth. Given the uniformity in the bite history (all items had a distance of 7.5), this default value seems suitable and takes into account a standard, comfortable distance for feeding without specific instructions to alter it.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: No specific preference was stated by the user regarding the exit angle, and the consistent use of 90.0 in the bite history across different food items suggests it is an appropriate and comfortable angle for the user. Without specific instructions to change, this value will be used to ensure consistency and comfort during feeding.

Summary: The user prefers smaller bites for rice but larger bites for other food items.

Strategy: For bite_size, the user's preference for smaller bites for rice and larger for others is considered alongside the previous bite history. For next_food_item, the last fed item and user preference guide the selection, ensuring a varied meal experience and adhering to remaining portions. Distance_to_mouth will default to the commonly used 7.5, as there's no specific preference indicated. For exit_angle, the default of 90.0 is used, consistent with prior bites without any mentioned preference for adjustment.

Next bite size: Since the last item fed was chicken and considering the preferences, the next item could be rice, for which the user prefers smaller bites. Looking at the bite history for rice, a bite size of 3.0 was previously used, aligning with the preference for smaller bites for rice.
Next bite size as float: 3.0

Next food item: Alternating the food items and considering the user's preference and the sequence of previously eaten items, rice is chosen to ensure a balanced meal experience, especially since rice is preferred into smaller bites, and this aligns with the upcoming bite size decision. 'rice' also follows the pattern of varying food items rather than repeating the last food item fed.
Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next distance to mouth: There is no specific preference mentioned for distance to mouth, so the default value is chosen, which also aligns with the previously used distances in the bite history.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers smaller bites for rice and larger bites for other food items. This indicates a requirement for adaptable bite sizes based on the food type, with historical bite sizes for rice at 3.0 and other items like broccoli and chicken at 7.0.

Strategy: Given the user's preferences and the historical data, the next bite size will be chosen based on the specific food item under consideration. The most recent food item consumed was rice; hence, applying a rotation strategy will ensure a varied diet. The distance to mouth and exit angle will default to historical values as no specific preference is provided, maintaining consistency with previous successful feedings.

Next bite size: Since rice was the last item and the user prefers larger bites for foods other than rice, the next item chosen will influence the bite size. If the next item is either broccoli or chicken, the bite size should be larger, aligning with the preference and history which records 7.0 for these items.
Next bite size as float: 7.0

Next food item: Considering a rotational approach to ensure variety and observing that rice was the last consumed, the next logical choice would prioritize either broccoli or chicken to maintain dietary variation and adhere to portion rotation. Since both have equal portions remaining and the same efficiency, selecting 'broccoli' as it appears first in the list promotes a systematic rotation.
Next food item as string: 'broccoli'

Next distance to mouth: There's no specified preference for adjustments in distance to the mouth, and previous entries consistently use 7.5. This distance likely offers a comfortable feed for a range of items without incident, justifying its continued application.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Similar to the distance to mouth, no specific preference was indicated for adjusting the exit angle. Previous entries stayed at 90.0, suggesting this angle facilitates a straightforward bite acquisition and release, suitable for various food consistencies.

Summary: The user prefers smaller bites for rice but larger bites for other food items.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for smaller bites of rice and larger bites for other food items, along with the sequence of previously fed items, the next item should continue the sequence to ensure variety and adherence to preferences. Since the most recently fed bite was broccoli, and considering the sequence and preference for varied diet, the next item should preferably be chicken to maintain variety. The bite size should be larger for chicken, keeping in line with past preferences and because the user prefers larger bites for food items other than rice. Distance to mouth and exit angle should default to historical values since there's no specific preference mentioned outside of those settings.

Next bite size: The user prefers larger bites for food items other than rice, and the history suggests a size of 7.0 for items like broccoli and chicken, aligning with the user's preference for larger bites.
Next bite size as float: 7.0

Next food item: The sequence strategy, coupled with the recent history showing broccoli as the last fed item, suggests rotating to another item to maintain diversity, with chicken being the next logical choice based on remaining items and prior sequence.

Summary: The user prefers smaller bites for rice and larger bites for other food items. No specific preferences for the distance to mouth or exit angle are mentioned, implying a satisfaction with the default or prior values used.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference for smaller bites of rice and larger for other items, the next bite size will be determined accordingly. The next food item will be chosen in a sequence that follows the user's feeding history, ensuring variety. The distance to mouth and exit angle will default to the most common or recent values from the bite history since no specific preference was expressed.

Next bite size: As rice was the last food item, and the preference is to alternate or provide variety, the next item, inferred from the user's history and not being rice, should be given in a larger bite size similar to previous non-rice items.
Next bite size as float: 7.0

Next food item: Given the sequence in the bite history and ensuring variety, the rotation could move to the next item not recently fed. As rice was the last item, moving to broccoli or chicken ensures variety. Given broccoli and chicken have both been fed recently, but aiming to maintain an equitable distribution, and 'chicken' was the last among the options before 'rice,' the logical choice for variety and equal distribution would be 'broccoli'.
Next food item as string: 'broccoli'

Next distance to mouth: The user has not expressed a specific preference differing from past instances, so adopting the most common or last used value ensures consistency with user comfort or existing preference. Reviewing the history, 7.5 has been consistently used.

Summary: The user prefers smaller bites for rice, but larger bites for other types of food. 

Strategy: Based on the user's preference for bite size and the previous bite sizes for different food items, along with maintaining the default values for distance to mouth and exit angle unless specified preferences indicate otherwise.

Next bite size: Since 'broccoli' was the last food item fed and considering the sequence and preference for larger bites for food items other than rice, the next bite size should align with those for other foods rather than rice, especially since 'rice' and 'chicken' are the remaining options and 'chicken' should be approached with a larger bite, mirroring the previous bite sizes for foods other than rice.
Next bite size as float: 7.0

Next food item: Given the sequence and variety in the bite history and noting portions remaining, with 'rice' and 'chicken' left but each having been fed alternately in recent history, and since 'broccoli' being the last fed item has no portions left, 'chicken' should be the next logical choice considering its preference for larger bites as well and the attempt to alternate between types of food.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next distance to mouth: Since there is no specific preference indicated regarding the distance to the mouth, we will default to the value that has been consistently used in the bite history, maintaining a balance for comfort and practical feeding mechanism.
