=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to start with soup, followed by rice, suggesting a sequential approach to the meal. They also indicate a preference for closer feeding when it comes to soup.

Strategy: Based on the summary, the strategy will address the user's preference for starting with soup and ensuring the distance to mouth is closer than the default distance. Since there's no history, default values or specifically mentioned preferences will guide the decision-making.

Next bite size: Given that the first item is soup, it's essential to consider that soup requires a smaller bite size to manage liquid effectively and ensure safety. While the default is 5.0, considering the nature of soup, starting with a smaller bite size seems prudent, although specific preferences on the bite size for soup were not mentioned. A slightly smaller than default value is chosen to ensure ease of consumption and to cater to the soup's liquidity.

Next bite size as float: 3.5

Next food item: The preference explicitly states to start with soup, which fits with the available list of items remaining. Since there's no previous food item (bite history is empty), choosing the food item aligns directly with the user's stated preference of beginning with soup.

Next food item as string: 'soup'

Next distance to mouth: The user specifically mentions feeding closer for soup, indicating a preference for a distance shorter than the default of 7.5. Since soup is generally easier to consume without large movements, decreasing the distance to ensure comfort and avoid spillage seems valid.

Next distance to mouth as float: 5.0

Next exit angle: No specific preference for the exit angle was stated for soup or any other food item. Therefore, the default exit angle of 90.0 will be used. This mid-range value should be suitable for a broad range of textures and ensure a neutral position for smooth feeding without specific instructions to alter it.

Summary: The user has expressed a preference to start with soup, followed by rice, and desires the soup to be fed closer to them.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference for starting with soup and then rice, as well as the desire to be fed closer when consuming soup, we can deduce several parameters. Since the last food item fed was soup with specific parameters, we'll follow their cue for the next bite choices.

Next bite size: The last bite size for soup was 3.5, which is smaller than the default. Since the preference for soup has already been addressed and the next preference is rice, which typically does not require a smaller bite size (as opposed to soup), we will adjust the bite size to the default of 5.0, given no specific instruction on the size for rice. 

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The user's preference was to start with soup and then move to rice. Given that soup was already provided, the natural progression based on their preference and sequence is to move to rice as the next food item.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next distance to mouth: The user has specified a preference for being fed closer for soup. However, since the next item is rice, and there's no stated preference for distance for rice, the default distance of 7.5 will be used, which is a middle ground that can be adjusted if feedback is provided.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Since there were no explicit preferences regarding the exit angle for any food item, including rice, and considering that the last exit angle used for soup was 90.0 without any feedback suggesting it was unsuitable, we will continue with the exit angle of 90.0 for rice.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to start with soup and then move on to rice, suggesting the sequence of food items to be followed. Additionally, they prefer the soup to be fed closer to them, which implies that distance to mouth should be smaller for soup.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference for starting with soup and then moving on to rice, and considering the bite history, we aim to adjust the parameters to match the user's preferences and the sequence of feeding. Soup has already been served twice, indicating it might be time to move on to the next item as per user's preference, which is rice.

Next bite size: Given the previous bite size for soup was 3.5 and for rice was 5.0, and no specific preference for the size of the bite for rice was mentioned by the user after the soup, we'll maintain the default bite size value for rice, which aligns with the history and also balances between too small and too large bites.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: Since soup was mentioned to be the starting item followed by rice, and considering the eating sequence preferred by the user along with the history indicating that soup has already been served, the next logical choice is rice. This respects the user's specified sequence of food items.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next distance to mouth: The user specifically mentioned feeding closer for soup. However, since the next item is rice and no specific preference for rice's distance was mentioned, and considering the previous setting for rice was at a default distance, we will maintain the default distance. This ensures comfort and efficiency based on the absence of specific instructions for rice.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: There has been no specific preference stated for the exit angle for any of the food items, including rice. Given this, along with the previous setting for rice which effectively used the default exit angle without issue, we will maintain this default to ensure consistency and user's comfort during feeding.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference starts with soup, followed by rice, indicating a sequence in their meal intake. They also prefer the soup to be fed closer to them, suggesting a shorter distance to mouth for soup.

Strategy: Based on the user's preferences and the bite history, the strategy aims to match the specified sequence of food items and adjust the parameters to the user's comfort and prior settings used for similar food types.

Next bite size: The bite history shows varying bite sizes for different food items but doesn't explicitly suggest changes for soup or rice. Since there's no specific request for bite size changes for the next item and considering the last item fed was rice, which deviates from the user's sequence preference, directing back to the preference, the starting point should be soup. There’s also an implicit understanding that soup, being a liquid or semi-liquid, might not necessarily suit the concept of bite size the same way solid food does. However, to maintain consistency in parameterization, a smaller bite size might be logical considering it's likely scooped in smaller quantities. Given this context and the priority to switch back to soup according to preference, a smaller bite size seems appropriate to facilitate easier consumption and perhaps a more careful delivery of a potentially liquid item. 

Next bite size as float: 3.0

Next food item: Given the preference is to start with soup and then move to rice, and considering the bite history where soup was followed by rice, it's important to adhere to the user’s initial preference and also note that there still are portions of soup left. Since the most recent food was rice, aligning with the preference to start with soup, the next food item logically should be soup to continue following the user's desired sequence.

Next food item as string: 'soup'

Next distance to mouth: The user has specifically mentioned they'd like the soup to be fed closer. The bite history for soup shows a distance of 5.0 initially, which aligns perfectly with the user's request. Therefore, adhering to this specific preference for soup, maintaining a closer distance to mouth is both in line with the user's comfort and supported by prior data. 

Next distance to mouth as float: 5.0

Next exit angle: There's no specific preference indicated for the angle of exit, so the default and prior settings should offer guidance. The bite history doesn’t suggest a variation for exit angles across different food items, with each documented angle at 90.0. Thus, remaining consistent with previous parameters where the exit angle has worked satisfactorily across different food items makes sense.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to start their meal with soup, followed by rice, and desires the soup to be fed closer to them.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference for starting with soup and then moving on to rice, and the fact that soup needs to be fed closer, the next item to be chosen should follow the sequence mentioned if available. The bite size and distance to mouth will align with the specific needs for the soup or rice based on history and preference. For exit angle, there were no specific preferences mentioned, so the default or historical values will be employed.

Next bite size: Given the preference for starting with soup, which is a liquid and requires a smaller bite size for easier consumption, looking at the bite history, soup was previously served with a bite size of 3.5 and 3.0. To maintain consistency and considering it's easier to consume, a slightly smaller size compared to the default seems appropriate to ensure it's manageable.
Next bite size as float: 3.0

Next food item: The user expressed a preference to start with soup followed by rice. According to the bite history, both items have been previously served. Given the stated preference and to follow the desired sequence while also taking into account that every food item should be offered, and considering what's left in the portions remaining, 'soup' is the natural next choice as it complies with the starting preference and assuming all servings must be offered evenly.
Next food item as string: 'soup'

Next distance to mouth: The user specified for soup to be fed closer. The bite history for soup shows a distance of 5.0 for both instances it was fed, aligning with the user's preference. Using this specific cue, the same distance will be chosen to ensure comfort and ease of feeding for the soup.
Next distance to mouth as float: 5.0

Next exit angle: There were no specific preferences indicated for exit angle concerning feeding. So, looking at the historical values where soup was served, a 90.0 angle was used both times. This angle seems standard and appropriate for feeding without any additional preferences mentioned, thereby following the same strategy for consistency.

Summary: The user prefers to start their meal with soup, followed by rice, indicating a sequence preference. Additionally, they have requested for bites of soup to be fed closer to their mouth.

Strategy: Considering the user’s preference for starting with soup and then moving on to rice, along with the request for closer feeding for soup, the determination of parameters takes into account both these aspects as well as the bite history to maintain consistency with past successful feeding attempts.

Next bite size: Since the last food item fed was soup and considering the preference for beginning with soup followed by rice, and observing the bite sizes for soup in the history (3.5 and 3.0), a similar smaller bite size is chosen to continue accommodating the user's comfort and preference for smaller bites for soup.
Next bite size as float: 3.0

Next food item: The preference was to start with soup and then move to rice. Considering the bite history where soup was the last fed item and the available portion indicates a sequence where soup is to be continued until finished before moving to the next item, the next food item should be soup to follow this sequence and preference.
Next food item as string: 'soup'

Next distance to mouth: The user has requested to be fed closer for soup, which is consistent with the previously recorded distances for soup in the bite history (5.0). Thus, continuing with this preference for proximity in feeding soup.
Next distance to mouth as float: 5.0

Next exit angle: There is no explicit preference stated for the exit angle, hence it’s reasonable to use the default value provided in the history for soup, which is 90.0, to ensure consistency with past successful feedings.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to start with soup, followed by rice, and desires the food to be fed closer when eating soup.

Strategy: Since the user has a defined preference for starting with soup and then moving to rice, along with a desire for the food to be closer when consuming soup, these preferences will guide the adjustments to the parameters. Given the bite history and the preference for closer feeding with soup, we will mimic the successful parameters previously used for soup, ensuring comfort and preference alignment. 

Next bite size: As the last few bites of soup had a size of around 3.0 to 3.5, and considering it's a liquid or semi-liquid food, maintaining a smaller bite size sounds logical and matches the user's past consumption pattern.
Next bite size as float: 3.0

Next food item: Based on the preference to start with soup and then move to rice, and noticing that soup has been consumed repeatedly in the recent history, it's appropriate to transition to the next preference, which is rice, especially considering the sequence and user preference.
Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next distance to mouth: The preference clearly states "Feed closer for soup." Since the next food item chosen is rice, and considering the default for non-soup items has been 7.5 based on past consumption, it's reasonable to maintain this default distance since no specific preference was indicated for rice.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: No specific preference was indicated for the exit angle, and since the default in recent history for both soup and rice has been 90.0, it appears to be a comfortable angle for the user. Therefore, maintaining this angle seems like the best option.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to start with soup, then move to rice, indicating a preference for a sequence in feeding. They also prefer bites of soup to be delivered closer to their mouth.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference and the bite history, adjustments to parameters will aim to transition smoothly from the user's last preference to the remaining food items, considering the user's comfort and the sequence of feeding.

Next bite size: Since the last food item consumed was rice with a bite size of 3.0, which is smaller than the default, and considering the transition from soup to rice, maintaining a smaller bite size is sensible. The user did not state a specific preference for bite size apart from the sequence, so it's reasonable to continue with a smaller bite size for comfort and consistency.

Next bite size as float: 3.0

Next food item: Given the sequence mentioned by the user (starting with soup and then moving to rice) and considering 'soup' portions have been finished (as indicated by portions remaining and the sequence of consumption), the next logical choice based on the user's preference and the remaining food items would be rice, as it also follows the sequence mentioned by the user.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next distance to mouth: The user expressed a preference for feeding closer with soup. Given the soup is now finished and we are moving to rice, which the user has not specified a distance preference for, we would default to the previous distance used for rice for consistency. The last distance to mouth for rice was 7.5, suggesting a standard distance without specific instructions otherwise.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: There's no explicit preference stated for exit angle; thus, we should default to the most recent exit angle used for rice to ensure consistency and comfort for the user. The last recorded exit angle for rice in the bite history was 90.0, which seems to be a comfortable angle for the user.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to start with soup and then move onto rice. They have requested that the soup be fed closer to them. There are no more portions of soup or rice left, with only beef remaining.

Strategy: The food items will be chosen based on the user's preference sequence and remaining portions. Since soup and rice portions are finished, the robot will feed beef next. The bite size and distance to mouth for beef will be determined based on previous preferences for other food items and the general requirement for feeding closer with soup. Since there are no previous instances of feeding beef, and no specific user preference has been stated for beef, the default or historical values will be adapted from similar contexts. The exit angle doesn't have a specified preference, so it will be set to the default, which worked well previously.

Next bite size: Since there are no previous instances or specific preferences for beef, and considering the transition to a potentially denser food item than soup or rice (assuming beef is solid), a moderate bite size slightly larger than the smaller bites chosen for soup but consistent with rice could ensure ease of eating. However, considering beef's nature, a slightly larger bite might be reasonable.
Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: Given that portions of soup and rice are finished and the user's preference sequence was to start with soup and then move to rice, beef is the next logical choice as it's the only remaining food item.
Next food item as string: 'beef'

Next distance to mouth: There's no specific request for the distance to feed beef. Since the previous distances used for soup (closer to mouth) were adjusted based on a specific request, and rice was fed at a default or neutral distance, a similar approach should be taken for beef, considering it doesn't require special closeness.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Without specific instructions to adjust the exit angle differently for beef, and acknowledging that the default exit angle of 90.0 degrees worked well for both soup and rice, it would be pragmatic to maintain this setting for beef.

Summary: The user prefers to start their meal with soup, then move on to rice, and prefers the robot to feed them at a closer distance when serving soup. There's no specific preference mentioned for the bite size or exit angle but can infer preferences from the bite history.

Strategy: Since 'soup' and 'rice' have been consumed entirely based on portions remaining (0 portions left for both), the next food item by default should be 'beef', the only remaining food item with portions left. The bite size for beef previously was 5.0, which can be used again considering there was no feedback suggesting a change. The distance to mouth for beef in the history was 7.5, and since there's no mention of preference for beef, we'll use this value again. Similarly, the exit angle in the previous beef bite was 90.0, with no new preferences indicating a change, so we'll use 90.0 again.

Next bite size: Since the previous bite size for beef was 5.0 and there's no indication the user wants to change it, we'll keep it the same to ensure consistency.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The next food item to feed is chosen based on the sequence of user preference and portions remaining. Since both 'soup' and 'rice' have no portions left and the user has already consumed them, the next logical choice is 'beef', the only remaining item with portions left.

Next food item as string: 'beef'

Next distance to mouth: There was a preference mentioned for feeding closer for soup but no specific preference for beef. Since the last recorded distance for beef was 7.5, we'll use this as it aligns with the previous data and no new preference has been stated.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: No specific preference has been mentioned for changing the exit angle for feeding beef. The previous exit angle used for beef was 90.0. Considering there's no feedback suggesting a need for change, we'll maintain the same angle.
