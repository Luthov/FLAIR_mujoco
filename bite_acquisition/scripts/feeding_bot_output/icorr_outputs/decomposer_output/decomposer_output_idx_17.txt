Serve alternating bites of rice and chicken.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of rice and chicken.

Strategy: Given there are no previous bites, we will start with the user's first preference, rice, and select a default bite size since there's no specific size preference indicated.

Next bite size: Since no specific size preference is provided and it's the start of the meal, a default medium size (5.0) is a balanced choice.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
Next food item: Since no previous bites were taken and the user prefers alternating bites of rice and chicken, starting with rice makes the most sense to adhere to their preference.
Next food item as string: 'rice'
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Hold the spoon farther for rice.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to hold the spoon farther away when eating rice.
Strategy: Given the preference for holding the spoon further when eating rice and the absence of any previous bite history or specific instructions regarding the exit angle, the approach will be to select a value greater than the default for distance_to_mouth and maintain the default for exit_angle.
Next distance to mouth: Since the preference is to hold the spoon farther for rice and no past data to indicate a preferred distance, choosing a value greater than the default 7.5 but within the specified range. 8.5 seems a prudent choice, providing an increased distance without excessive reach.
Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5
Next exit angle: Without specific instructions or preferences for the tilt and no bite history to draw upon, the default value is maintained to ensure ease of use and consistency.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have bites of rice and chicken served in alternating order.

Strategy: Since the previous bite was rice and considering the user's preference for alternating between rice and chicken, the next item should be chicken. The bite size previously was 5.0, and without any indication of preference for larger or smaller bites, we will maintain the same size to ensure consistency in the eating experience.

Next bite size: No specific preference for changing the bite size was indicated, so we will keep it the same as the last bite to maintain consistency.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
Next food item: Given the user's preference for alternating between rice and chicken, and the last item eaten being rice, the next logical choice is chicken to follow their desired sequence.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Hold the spoon farther for rice.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be held farther away when eating rice.

Strategy: For the upcoming bite which is chicken, since there's no specified preference for chicken, we'll look at the bite history and the provided preference for guidance. Given that rice (a similar lightweight food item) was previously eaten with the spoon held farther away, we will adjust parameters that possibly cater to the similarity in food texture and type, but default closer to the standard values as no specific preference for chicken is mentioned.

Next distance to mouth: Since chicken is being eaten next and there's no specified preference for it, compared to rice, we'll opt for a slightly closer distance than what was used for rice, but still above the default, hypothesizing that a bit more control is necessary for chicken than rice, which might be lighter.
Next distance to mouth as float: 8.0

Next exit angle: With no explicit preference mentioned for chicken, and considering that the exit angle for rice was kept at a neutral 90.0 degrees, we'll maintain this angle for consistency in the absence of specific direction, as it seems to be an optimal balance for different food types.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have alternating bites of rice and chicken.

Strategy: Based on the user's preference for alternating bites of rice and chicken and considering the bite history which shows that the last bite was chicken with a size of 5.0, the next food item should be rice to maintain the alternating pattern. Since there's no specific preference mentioned for changing the bite size and the previous bite sizes were satisfactory, we'll stick to the default value of 5.0.

Next bite size: The previous bites were set at 5.0, and there has been no specific preference indicated for changing this size, so we'll continue with this size.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
Next food item: Following the user's alternating preference and given that the last item fed was chicken, the next item in the sequence should logically be rice to maintain the pattern.
Next food item as string: 'rice'
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Hold the spoon farther for rice.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to hold the spoon farther away when eating rice.

Strategy: For the distance_to_mouth, the preference indicates a value at the higher end of the range for rice, and the history shows a previous distance of 8.5 for rice, which aligns with this preference. For the exit_angle, there's no specific preference indicated for rice or in general, so the default and previous history for rice, which is 90.0, will be used.

Next distance to mouth: Given the preference for holding the spoon farther when eating rice and the previous distance used for rice was 8.5, it's reasonable to match this since it aligns with the user preference.
Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5
Next exit angle: There is no specific preference indicated for exit angle with rice, and previous rice consumption used an exit angle of 90.0, so we'll stick with this default value to maintain consistency.

Serve alternating bites of rice and chicken.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to alternate between bites of rice and chicken.
Strategy: Since the last item eaten was rice and the user prefers alternating between rice and chicken, the next item should be chicken. The default bite size has been 5.0 for all items, and there's no specific preference indicating a need to deviate from this standard size.

Next bite size: Keep consistent with the user's history and default value.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
Next food item: Following the alternating preference and the last item consumed, chicken is the next reasonable choice.
Next food item as string: 'chicken'
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Hold the spoon farther for rice.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers holding the spoon further away when eating rice.

Strategy: For the distance_to_mouth parameter, we'll evaluate the user's preference for rice and compare it to the previous values used for chicken, considering that no specific preference is mentioned for chicken. For the exit angle, since there's no explicit preference mentioned, we'll rely on the history of previously used angles to determine the most appropriate setting.

Next distance to mouth: Given the preference to hold the spoon further for rice and that the previous distance used for chicken was 8.0, we will use a slightly closer distance than that used for rice but maintain a distance that acknowledges the different nature of chicken as a bite. Therefore, a value slightly less than 8.0 should be suitable, given the absence of a specific preference for chicken.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Since no specific preference for exit angle is mentioned for either rice or chicken, and the historical data shows a consistent use of 90.0 degrees, it's rational to continue with this angle. It has been satisfactory for both rice and chicken in the past.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Serve alternating bites of rice and chicken.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of rice and chicken, indicating a sequence that alternates between these two types of food. 

Strategy: Given the bite history, the last food item was chicken, so following the user's preference for alternation, the next food item should be rice. As for the bite size, since there has been a consistent choice of 5.0 with no specific request for a change, we will continue to use the default size of 5.0. Considering the remaining portions and efficiency, adhering to the user’s eating sequence and preference is also efficient and accommodates the available portions of rice and chicken.

Next bite size: Since the historical bite sizes have all been 5.0 and there has been no expressed desire for change, we'll maintain this value for consistency and user satisfaction.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The previous item served was chicken, and based on the user’s preference for alternation, the next item should logically be rice to continue following the desired pattern of alternating between rice and chicken.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers holding the spoon farther away when eating rice.

Strategy: Considering the user’s preference for a farther distance to mouth when eating rice and the past choices from the bite history, we'll adjust the parameters accordingly. For the exit angle, since there's no specific preference stated, we'll evaluate the bite history to maintain consistency.

Next distance to mouth: Since the user prefers the spoon to be held farther for rice and the previous distances chosen for rice were 8.5, it's reasonable to continue with this pattern for consistency and to align with user preference.
Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5

Next exit angle: Given the lack of specific preference towards the exit angle for rice and all previous exit angles were set at 90.0, maintaining this consistency should meet the user's expectations while providing a comfortable eating experience.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is for alternating bites of rice and chicken.

Strategy: Since all previous bites were sized at 5.0 and there's no mention of needing to change this, the bite size will remain the same. For the next food item, considering the alternating pattern indicated in the user's preference and the most recent bite being rice, the next food item should be chicken to continue adhering to the user's preference. Additionally, noting the portions remaining, both rice and chicken have the same remaining quantity, which supports continuing the pattern without adjustments.

Next bite size: Given the history and absence of instructions to vary, maintaining consistency with a bite size of 5.0.

Hold the spoon farther for rice.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be held farther away when eating rice. There is no explicit preference mentioned for chicken, but based on the bite history, distance and exit angle can potentially be adjusted based on past preferences.

Strategy: Since the next bite is chicken, and the user has had chicken with settings of 8.0 and 7.5 distance_to_mouth, both with a 90.0 exit angle, it's prudent to look at the history to discern a pattern or preference. There's a slight preference for holding the spoon a bit farther away for chicken compared to the default but not as far as for rice. For the exit angle, there doesn't seem to be a change from the default, indicating no specific preference there.

Next distance to mouth: Given the user's history with chicken having been served at 8.0 and 7.5, and considering the absence of an explicit preference for chicken, a middle ground that leans slightly further seems appropriate. This should meet the user's implicit preference as discerned from the history.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.75

Next exit angle: There is no indicated preference for adjusting the exit angle for chicken, and the history shows a consistent use of the default 90.0 angle. Therefore, it's best to stick with the default value, considering no new information suggests a different preference.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Serve alternating bites of rice and chicken.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to serve alternating bites of rice and chicken.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference for alternating between rice and chicken, and observing the bite history which shows a consistent approach towards maintaining a default bite size of 5.0 for both rice and chicken, the decision for the next parameters adheres to this pattern. Given that the last item fed was chicken, the next logical item based on the user's alternating preference will be rice.

Next bite size: Since the bite history consistently shows a bite size of 5.0 for both rice and chicken, without any specific instruction to alter the size, maintaining this default value aligns with the established pattern and user's likely expectation.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: Given the user's preference for alternating between rice and chicken, and the most recent bite being chicken, the next item should be rice to maintain this pattern. Additionally, the presence of rice in the items remaining list supports this choice.

Next food item as string: 'rice'
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Hold the spoon farther for rice.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers holding the spoon farther away for rice compared to other foods.
Strategy: Since the preference indicates a farther distance for rice, and the bite history shows that rice bites have consistently been at a distance of 8.5, we will maintain this distance for consistency and to respect user preference. The exit angle has not changed in the bite history, consistently remaining at 90.0 for all foods, indicating no specific preference for altering the tilt based on the food type. Thus, the exit angle will remain at the default of 90.0.
Next distance to mouth: Since the user prefers the spoon to be held farther for rice and historical distances for rice are consistently at 8.5, the same distance will be applied.
Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Serve alternating bites of rice and chicken.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference involves serving alternating bites of rice and chicken.

Strategy: Given the detailed history of past bites and current items remaining, the strategy is to continue serving alternating bites of rice and chicken, respecting user preference for variety and adhering to the sequence mentioned. Considering there's no specific preference mentioned for changing the bite size, maintain the current size that has been consistently chosen.

Next bite size: Since the historical bite sizes have uniformly been 5.0 and no new preference regarding size has been expressed, it is most logical to continue with this size to ensure consistency and meet the user's expectations.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next food item: The last food item served was rice, adhering to the alternating preference, and since there's more chicken left than rice, and to continue the sequence, the next logical choice is chicken. It also fits the user's preference for alternating between rice and chicken.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Hold the spoon farther for rice.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be held farther away for rice. Given this preference and the provided bite history, one can infer preferences for both rice and chicken related to the distance to mouth parameter. There are no explicit preferences for exit angle.

Strategy: Since the user prefers the spoon farther for rice, and the distance for rice bites has consistently been 8.5, whereas for chicken, the distance has varied slightly around a shorter distance, it is reasonable to set the next bite for chicken at a distance that reflects this preference and prior pattern, slightly adjusting based on the historical trend to hone in on a potentially preferred distance.

Next distance to mouth: Given the historical distances for chicken (8.0, 7.5, 7.75), there seems to be a slight preference for closer distances than for rice. The last distance for chicken was 7.75; adjusting slightly to see if a minor change enhances the experience, setting it at 7.75 seems appropriate as it reflects the last known preference with an aim for consistency.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.75

Next exit angle: There has been no specific preference indicated for the exit angle, and all previous bites, regardless of the food type, have been set to 90.0. It seems appropriate to continue with this setting as it aligns with past behavior and no new preference has been communicated.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to alternate between bites of rice and chicken.

Strategy: Based on the bite history, the last item consumed was chicken. The user prefers alternating between rice and chicken. Given that both rice and chicken are now gone, and only broccoli is available, we need to adjust to serving what’s available. Since the preference was to alternate, and broccoli is the only food item left with portions remaining, it's the logical choice. The bite size has consistently been 5.0, and without any specific preferences to adjust this, we'll maintain this default value.

Next bite size: Maintaining the default bite size of 5.0 due to absence of specific preference for adjustment and consistency in prior choices.
Next bite size as float: 5.0

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
Hold the spoon farther for rice.
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers holding the spoon farther away for rice. No explicit preference for other types of food or for the exit angle is mentioned.

Strategy: Since the next bite is broccoli, and there is no specific preference mentioned for broccoli, we will consider the distances used for chicken, as it's the closest in texture mentioned in the bite history. The exit angle has consistently been 90.0 for all types of food, suggesting no specific preference for adjusting the exit angle based on the type of food.

Next distance to mouth: The distances used for chicken were 8.0, 7.5, 7.75, 7.75. Given these values are closer than the distances used for rice but not the closest possible, we'll average these distances for broccoli, leaning towards a slightly further distance given the lack of specificity for broccoli, but closer than rice. This averages to 7.75.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.75

Next exit angle: Since the exit angle has consistently been 90.0 across all food types, and no specific preference has been mentioned for adjusting this based on food type, we will keep it at the default of 90.0.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of rice and chicken. However, it appears that rice and chicken portions are finished, leaving only broccoli available for feeding.

Strategy: Since rice and chicken are not available and preferences involve alternating between these two, the next logical choice considering what is available and the efficiency of serving what's left, broccoli is chosen. The bite size has consistently been 5.0 for all previous items, suggesting this is a comfortable size for the user. Therefore, we will maintain this size.

Summary: The user prefers the spoon to be held farther away when eating rice, indicating a preference for adjusting the distance based on the type of food. No specific preference for exit angle is mentioned, so it defaults to 90.0 unless otherwise indicated in the bite history or instructions.

Strategy: Since the next bite is broccoli, and the only specific preference mentioned involves rice, we'll look at the previous broccoli bite for guidance on distance and use the default for exit angle due to lack of specific instructions.

Next distance to mouth: The last broccoli bite used a distance of 7.75, which suggests a slightly farther distance than the default may be preferred for broccoli. It's closer than rice but farther than chicken, following the theme of slightly adjusting based on the type of food.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.75
