RESPONSE:
Food Items Left: There are 5 servings each of carrot, chicken, and rice left on the plate.

Next bite: Feed rice
Next bite (accounting for efficiency): Feed rice, considering all items have equal efficiency.

Food Items Left: There are 5 portions each of carrot, chicken, and rice left on the plate.
Strategy: Given your preference to alternate between bites of rice and grilled chicken, saving the carrots for last, and considering that your last bite was chicken, the next bite will be rice. Your preference for larger meat bites and smaller vegetable bites, along with the specifics about distance and angle for rice feeding, will guide the parameters.

RESPONSE:
Food Items Left: The plate has 5 portions of carrots, 4 portions of chicken, and 5 portions of rice left.
Strategy: Based on your preference for alternating between rice and chicken while saving carrots for last, along with a preference for larger bites of meat and smaller bites of vegetables and specific instructions for distance to mouth and exit angle, I will start with rice since the previous bites alternated and ended with chicken. This will be followed by chicken, then rice, and so on, ensuring the carrots are saved for last as per your preference.
Next bite: Rice
Next bite (accounting for efficiency): Rice
Next bite as list: ['rice']
Next bite size: Given the preference for smaller vegetable bites which include rice and previous rice bites having a default size, I will choose a smaller bite size for rice.
Next bite size as float: 0.0
Next distance to mouth: Since there is a preference for keeping the spoon closer to the mouth when feeding rice, and considering the previous values, I will choose a closer distance.
Next distance to mouth as float: 5.0
Next exit angle: With a preference for tilting the spoon a little higher when feeding rice and based on previous rice bites' exit angles, I will choose a higher angle.

RESPONSE:
Food Items Left: There are 5 portions of carrot, 4 portions of chicken, and 4 portions of rice left on the plate.
Strategy: Considering your preferences, I will alternate between feeding you bites of rice and chicken, starting with rice to follow the pattern established by your previous bites. The carrots will be saved for last as per your preference. The larger bites will be chicken, smaller bites will be vegetables, and the rice will be served with a closer spoon distance and a slightly higher exit angle.
Next bite: Feed rice
Next bite (accounting for efficiency): Feed rice
Next bite as list: ['rice']
Next bite size: Since no specific bite size preference was mentioned for rice beyond past behavior and you like alternating with chicken with "default" sizes, I'll continue with the default size for rice.
Next bite size as float: 0.0
Next distance to mouth: Since the preference is to keep the spoon closer to your mouth when feeding rice, I'll choose a closer distance based on past behaviors.
