Summary: The user prefers alternating bites between chicken and rice with large bites. They prefer to be fed slower and want the spoon further from their mouth.

Strategy: Given there's no bite history, we start with chicken or rice as the first item, then select the parameters based on the user's preferences and default values for parameters not specified.

Next food item: Since there's no previous food item (no bite history), we can start with chicken or rice. We'll start with 'chicken' as the next food item to adhere to the alternating bites preference and considering all portions are equal and have remaining.

Next food item as string: 'chicken'

Next bite size: The user wants large bites, so we'll choose a value higher than the default. Since the scale goes up to 10.0 for the largest bite, a value closer to this end would satisfy the user's preference.

Next bite size as float: 8.5

Next speed of acquisition: No specific preference was mentioned for the speed of acquisition, so we default to the middle value.

Next speed of acquisition as float: 5.0

Next distance to mouth: The user prefers the spoon to be further away. The default is 7.5, on a scale from closer (5.0) to further (10.0); to satisfy this preference, we'll choose a value higher than the default.

Next distance to mouth as float: 8.5

Next exit angle: No specific preference was provided about the exit angle, so we go with the default value.

Next exit angle as float: 90.0

Next speed of transfer: The user prefers slower feeding, so we select a value lower than the middle value to provide a slower transfer rate.

Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and rice with a preference for large bites. When being fed, the user likes the spoon to move slower and to be further away. The history shows a large chicken bite was last, suggesting a preference for larger bites and adjustments for speed and distance that deviate from the defaults.

Strategy: Considering the user's preference for alternating food items and large bites, the next food item should be rice to alternate after chicken. The user's preference for large bites suggests increasing the default bite size. Preferences regarding the feeding process indicate a slower speed of transfer and the utensil being further from the mouth than the default.

Next food item: The last food item fed was chicken. Given the user's preference for alternating bites between chicken and rice and portions still being available for both, the next food item should be rice to maintain the alternating pattern.
Next food item as string: 'rice'

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and rice, indicating a desire for variety, with large bite sizes indicating a preference for generous portions. They also prefer to be fed more slowly, and for the spoon to be further away, indicating a preference for a slower, more cautious feeding approach.

Strategy: Based on the user's preferences and previous bite history, we will alternate to the next possible food item, which is chicken, given that the last item was rice. Large bites are preferred, so we'll use a value from the bite history that reflects this preference. For speed of acquisition and speed of transfer, we will adhere to previous values but adjust them slightly to reflect the user's desire for slower feeding. The distance to mouth and exit angle decisions will also be informed by bite history and preferences for a cautious approach and default values, respectively.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternate bites of chicken and rice with large bite sizes and slower feeding. The spoon should be further away during feeding. 

Strategy:
- Since the last food item consumed was rice, and the user prefers alternate bites between chicken and rice, the next food item should logically be chicken, considering there are portions left of chicken according to the "Items remaining" list.
- The user has a preference for large bites, and previous bites have had a bite size of 8.5. Given this information and the explicit preference for large bites, it's reasonable to continue with a large bite size.
- There is no specific preference mentioned regarding the speed of acquisition, so the default value based on the bite history, which has remained consistent at 5.0, will be used.
- The preference for the spoon to be further away is addressed with the distance to mouth parameter. Previous settings have gradually increased, indicating an adaptation to this preference. Choosing a value that reflects the user’s comfort and adhering to the most recent trend would be ideal.
- The exit angle has not been specified by the user, so it will remain at the previously used value of 90.0, which seems to be consistently comfortable based on bite history.
- The user's preference for slower feeding requires adjusting the speed of transfer accordingly. Previous values show a trend towards slower, with 3.0 being the consistent choice, pointing to this being the preferred speed.

Next food item: Given the alternation between chicken and rice and chicken being the next in line based on the pattern, we choose "chicken" considering portions of chicken are still available.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers alternating bites of chicken and rice with large bite sizes. For the transfer to the mouth, the preference is for slower speeds and the spoon to be further away.

Strategy: Given the alternating preference between chicken and rice, and considering the last item eaten was chicken, the next food item should be rice. As portions of rice are still available, this aligns with the user's preferences. The user prefers large bites, which, based on the history, translates to a value of 8.5 for bite size. Since there's no specific preference mentioned for the speed of acquisition, the default from the history (5.0) will be maintained. For the distance to the mouth, the user prefers it to be further, so we'll adopt the last used value of 9.0 which is further than the default. The exit angle preference isn't explicitly stated, so the historical angle of 90.0 is suitable. Lastly, for the speed of transfer, the user prefers a slower pace; therefore, referencing the last used slower speed of 3.0 will match the preference.

Next food item: Based on the alternating preference and considering the last bite was chicken, the next should be rice, which is also available per the portions remaining.

Summary: The user prefers alternation between bites of chicken and rice, wanting large bites for each. However, since both chicken and rice have been fully consumed (as indicated by zero portions remaining) and only broccoli remains, the preference shifts to the available item. The user also prefers a slower feeding rate and for the spoon to be positioned further from them.

Strategy: Given the remaining portions and user preferences, we will adjust parameters to accommodate the only available option, broccoli, while adhering to their desires for bite size, speed, and distance.

Next food item: The last item fed was rice, and the user prefers alternating bites. However, with chicken and rice no longer available and only broccoli remaining, the next logical choice is broccoli, given it's the only remaining food item with portions left.

Next food item as string: 'broccoli'

Next bite size: The preference was stated for large bites, and the historical large bite size was 8.5. As broccoli is the only option remaining and considering the preference for large bites, we will maintain this bite size to ensure satisfaction.

Next bite size as float: 8.5

Next speed of acquisition: No specific preference has been stated for the speed of food acquisition. Thus, it is reasonable to default to the historical value used for the previous items, maintaining consistency with the last speed observed in the bite history.

Next speed of acquisition as float: 5.0

Next distance to mouth: The preference for the spoon to be further away has been expressed. Historically, the distance to mouth increased to 9.0 in the recent parameters. To align with the preference for slower feeding and greater distance, we will continue with this adjustment.

Next distance to mouth as float: 9.0

Next exit angle: No specific preference regarding the exit angle has been voiced, and the historical parameter has consistently been set at 90.0. Therefore, we will maintain this value for the broccoli, providing a neutral position for exit.

Next exit angle as float: 90.0

Next speed of transfer: The user prefers to be fed slower, with historical values showing a preference towards the lower range (3.0) in the bite history for transfer speed. To honor the user's desire for slower feeding speeds, we adopt this pace once again.
