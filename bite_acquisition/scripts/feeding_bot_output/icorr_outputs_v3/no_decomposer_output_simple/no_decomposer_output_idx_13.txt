Summary: The userâ€™s preference is to have the spoon positioned closer to their mouth.

Strategy: Since the user prefers the spoon closer to their mouth, the value for distance_to_mouth will be adjusted to a lower value within its range, considering their last distance was the default 7.5 with no complaints, but preference now indicates a desire for closer. The next food item choice will consider what was recently fed ('yogurt') and the remaining portions of each item. Given the cycling through previous items for variety and the remaining portions, 'fruit', having more than one portion left and not being the most recent item, seems the next logical choice. The bite_size, speed_of_acquisition, exit_angle, and speed_of_transfer will default to their previous values since no specific preference was stated, assuming the user was satisfied with these parameters.

Next food item: Choosing 'fruit' as it is not the most recent item fed and has portions remaining, adhering to variety and availability.

=== RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to have the spoon positioned closer to their mouth during feeding.

Strategy: Since the user prefers the spoon to be closer, the distance_to_mouth parameter should be adjusted to reflect this preference. No specific preferences are mentioned for the other parameters, so the defaults or the values from the bite history will be used, ensuring a balanced approach based on what has been previously served and the need to alternate the food items to provide variety and address all remaining portions.

Next food item: The last food item served was 'yogurt'. To ensure variety and considering all items have the same portions remaining and efficiency, the next food item should be different from 'yogurt' and one that hasn't been served immediately before. Given the rotation in the bite history, it would be reasonable to follow the pattern and choose 'fruit' next, as 'yogurt' was the most recent and 'oatmeal' was served just before 'fruit' last appeared.

Next food item as string: 'fruit'
