Feed all the rice first, then alternate between chicken and vegetables.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to have all the rice served first, followed by an alternation between chicken and vegetables until all portions are consumed.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for food order and the portions remaining, the strategy is focused on satisfying the preference sequence and considering default values for bite_size and speed_of_acquisition in absence of any specific user preferences or previous bites history.

Next food item: Since the preference starts with rice and there's still rice remaining (2 portions), the next item should be rice to comply with the user's priority for feeding order. 

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: With no specific preference or previous bites to consider, the default bite size of 5.0 is chosen as it represents a balanced approach between too small and too large bites.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next speed of acquisition: Similarly, without any cues for speed preferences or history to adjust from, the default speed of 5.0 is selected. This speed is considered moderate and suitable for a wide range of scenarios.

=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: Since the user has not expressed any specific preferences and there is no bite history to refer to, the default parameters will be used for guiding the next spoonful of rice.
Strategy: The parameters are chosen based on the type of food and the absence of explicit user preferences or historical data. For rice, a moderate approach in all dimensions should ensure a smooth transfer without spillage.
Next distance to mouth: Defaulted to 7.5 since there is no expressed preference or prior bite history to suggest otherwise.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: Defaulted to 90.0 due to lack of specific preference or historical inclination, suitable for ensuring rice is neatly placed into the mouth.

None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: Since there are no explicit user preferences provided and no bite history to deduce any implicit preferences from, we will use the default values for all adjustable parameters.

Strategy: Because no specific preferences have been stated by the user and we have no history of prior bites to inform our decisions, we will stick with the default values for distance to mouth, exit angle, and speed of transfer. These defaults are designed to provide a balanced and neutral feeding experience that should be adequate for a wide range of foods and user comfort levels.

Next distance to mouth: With no preference or prior history to indicate otherwise, we choose the default distance to ensure a comfortable reach.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: We select the default exit angle to accommodate a straightforward and neutral spoon orientation, suitable for the consistency of rice.
Next exit angle as float: 90.0
Next speed of transfer: In the absence of any specified speed preference or historical data to suggest an adjustment is needed, we opt for the default speed to achieve a moderate pace.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers the feeding order to begin with all portions of rice, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables until all are consumed.

Strategy: Given the user's preference and the fact that all food items currently have the same number of portions remaining, the focus should be on satisfying the preference order. Since thereâ€™s no detailed preference on bite size or speed of acquisition and no prior bite history, default values will be used for these parameters with adjustments based on efficiency if relevant.

Next food item: As per the user's preference, all of the rice should be fed first before moving onto other food items. Since the bite history is empty, indicating the beginning of the feeding, rice will be chosen as it fits the preference and portions for rice are still available.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: No specific preferences were stated for bite size, and there is no history to suggest a deviation from the default. Therefore, the default value of 5.0 is maintained.

Next bite size as float: 5.0

Next speed of acquisition: With no specific preference for speed and no bite history to indicate previous speeds preferred, the default value of 5.0 is used to balance between too fast and too slow, potentially catering to a comfortable eating pace for the user.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has not expressed any specific preference for distance to mouth, exit angle, or speed of transfer for their next bite of rice. There is no bite history to infer any preference from either.

Strategy: Since there are no expressed preferences or bite history to inform decisions, I will set the parameters to the default values.

Next distance to mouth: The default value is used due to lack of preference and bite history.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5
Next exit angle: The default value is employed because there's no specified preference or previous data to guide the decision.
Next exit angle as float: 90.0
Next speed of transfer: I'm selecting the default speed as there's no indication of the user's preferred speed of transfer or any history to lean on.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers all the rice to be fed first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables, presumably until both are finished or the meal ends.

Strategy: Since rice should be fed first and there are still portions of rice remaining, the next food item should be rice. The bite size default is 5.0, and since there's no specific preference for smaller or larger bites or prior bite history to adjust from, we'll use the default size.

Next food item: Given the preference to feed all rice first and rice still being among the remaining portions, rice is the selected next food item.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: Without specific bite size preferences or history, the bite size will default to the middle value of 5.0 to ensure a standard portion size.

=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers all rice to be fed first, followed by an alternating pattern between chicken and vegetables until all portions are finished.

Strategy: According to the preference and remaining portions, rice should be prioritized until it is depleted. Since there are no prior bites and no specific bite size preference has been stated, the default bite size will be used. Considering the preference and available portions, the next food item should be rice, as it still has portions remaining and fits the sequence of feeding all the rice first.

Next food item: Based on user preference to feed all the rice first and considering that rice still has portions remaining, rice is selected as the next food item.
Next food item as string: 'rice'
Next bite size: No specific preference for bite size was stated, and there is no historical bite size to use for guidance; thus, the default value of 5.0 will be used.
