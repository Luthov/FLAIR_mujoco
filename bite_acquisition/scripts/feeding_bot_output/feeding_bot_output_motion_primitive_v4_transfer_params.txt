 RESPONSE:
Food Items Left: There are mashed potatoes, turkey, and green beans left on the plate, with portions of 2, 3, and 1 respectively.
Strategy: I will feed mashed potatoes first to honor your preference for eating all the mashed potatoes before moving onto the turkey, then have a bite of turkey, and end with green beans. The bite size for vegetables will be smaller than that for the meat, respecting your wish for larger bites of meat.

 RESPONSE:
Food Items Left: There are mashed potatoes with no portions left, turkey with 3 portions remaining, and green beans with 1 portion remaining.
Strategy: Based on the preference to eat all the mashed potatoes first (which are now finished), and then to proceed with turkey followed by green beans, the next item to focus on will be turkey. Given the larger bite preference for meat, I will serve a larger portion of turkey next, followed by a small portion of green beans to conclude.
