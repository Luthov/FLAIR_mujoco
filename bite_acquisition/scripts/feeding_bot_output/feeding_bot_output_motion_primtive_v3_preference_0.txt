 RESPONSE:
Food Items Left: There are 2 portions of mashed potato, 3 portions of turkey, and 1 portion of green bean left on the plate.
Strategy: The strategy is to follow your preference by feeding you all the mashed potatoes first because you want to eat all the mashed potatoes first before moving on to the other items. Since you prefer larger bites of meat and smaller bites of vegetables, the turkey bites will be larger than the vegetable bites when we get to those.

Strategy: Following the preference of eating all the mashed potatoes first, then having a bite of turkey, and finishing with some green beans, and considering the desire for larger bites of meat and smaller bites of vegetables, the plan is to feed mashed potatoes until they are finished, proceed with turkey in larger bites, and end with green beans in a smaller bite.

 RESPONSE:
Food Items Left: There are portions of turkey and green bean left on the plate, with 2 portions of turkey and 1 portion of green bean remaining. Mashed potato is fully consumed.  
Strategy: Following the preference to eat all of one food before moving onto the next where practical and considering the given bite preference for larger bites of meat and smaller bites of vegetables, the plan is to feed turkey next as it aligns with the order of preference and past bite sizes indicate a preference for larger bites of turkey. After turkey is consumed, green beans will be served.

 RESPONSE:
Food Items Left: Mashed potato is no longer available, turkey and green bean are left with one portion each.
