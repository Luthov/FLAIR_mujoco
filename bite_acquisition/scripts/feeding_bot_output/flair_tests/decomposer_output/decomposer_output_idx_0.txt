Feed all the rice first, then alternate between chicken and vegetables.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user prefers to eat all of the rice first, followed by an alternating pattern between chicken and vegetables.

Food Items Left: There are rice, chicken, and carrots left on the plate, each with two portions remaining.

Strategy: Since the user prefers to have all of one food item before moving on to the next and prefers to alternate between chicken and vegetables after finishing the rice, the next food item will be chosen based on what remains according to this preference order. Since there's no previous food item mentioned, I'll rely solely on the user's preference and the portions left.

Next food item: The preference is to feed all the rice first. Since there are still portions of rice remaining, the next food item to feed should be rice, adhering to the user's specified order of consumption.
Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: No specific preference was stated regarding the size of the bite, so the default value of 5.0 will be used.
Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: There is no specified preference from the user for the next bite, which is rice. Given the lack of expressed preference and no bite history to inform adjustments, default values for both parameters will be used.

Strategy: Since there is no preference or prior bite history to draw from, the default settings for both distance_to_mouth and exit_angle will be retained. These default values aim to provide a balanced approach suitable for a variety of foods, including rice, which does not require specific adjustments without explicit preferences.

Next distance to mouth: There is no specified preference or prior history to suggest a change; thus, the default value is chosen to accommodate a wide range of users comfortably.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Without specific preference or historical data indicating a need for adjustment, the default exit angle is maintained to ensure a neutral spoon tilt suitable for the rice.
Next exit angle as float: 90.0

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Feed all the rice first, then alternate between chicken and vegetables.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference indicates that all of the rice should be fed first, followed by alternating between chicken and vegetables.

Food Items Left: There are still portions remaining of rice, chicken, and carrots left on the plate, with each having 2 portions left.

Strategy: Given the user's preference for completing the consumption of all rice portions before moving onto the other foods and the fact that rice was the last food item fed, I will continue to follow the user's specific directive by continuing to feed rice until its portions are finished.

Next food item: Since there are still portions of rice remaining and the preference is to feed all of the rice first, the next food item should continue to be rice.
Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: The previous and only bite recorded was rice with a bite size of 5.0. There has been no specific preference stated for changing the bite size, so I will keep it at the default of 5.0.

=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user has not expressed any specific preference for the distance_to_mouth or the exit_angle based on the provided information. The only entry in the bite history indicates the use of default parameters for rice, which suggests that the default settings were satisfactory or that there's no basis for alterations from a single data point.

Strategy: Since there's no explicit preference stated and only a single entry in the bite history using default parameters, the strategy will be to retain the default values for both parameters. This approach assumes that the default settings are a safe baseline for the next spoonful of rice without specific feedback indicating a need for adjustment.

Next distance to mouth: The user's choice of parameters for the previous bite was the default 7.5. Without any expressed preference for adjustment, we'll use the same default distance for the next bite to ensure consistency and satisfaction based on the assumption that the previous settings were acceptable. 

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Since the previous setting used the default exit angle of 90.0 and there were no preferences indicating a change was necessary, we will maintain this angle. This decision is based on the assumption that the default settings provided a satisfactory experience that we aim to replicate for the next spoonful.

=== BITE PREFERENCE ===
Feed all the rice first, then alternate between chicken and vegetables.
=== BITE SEQUENCING RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is to finish all the rice first, then alternately feed chicken and vegetables.

Food Items Left: The items remaining on the plate are rice (1 portion), chicken (2 portions), and carrots (2 portions).

Strategy: Since all the rice should be fed first according to the user's preference, and considering there's still a portion of rice left, the strategy will be to continue feeding rice until it's finished. Since the last food item fed was rice as per the Bite History, it aligns with the strategy to continue with rice.

Next food item: As there is still a portion of rice remaining, and the preference is to feed all the rice first, the next food item should be rice to comply with the user's preference and the available portions.

Next food item as string: 'rice'

Next bite size: There is no specific preference mentioned different from before; thus, the default value of 5.0, as seen in the Bite History, will be used.

Next bite size as float: 5.0
=== TRANSFER PREFERENCE ===
None
=== TRANSFER PARAMS RESPONSE ===
Summary: The user's preference is unknown since there are no explicit cues about how they prefer the distance to mouth or the exit angle altered from their previous interactions. All previous interactions have utilized the default values for both adjustable parameters.

Strategy: Given the lack of specific preference cues or requests for adjustments from the user, the strategy will remain conservative, sticking with the known, default parameters that have been used thus far. This approach is based on the assumption that the absence of feedback or specific requests for adjustments implies satisfaction with the current settings or, at the very least, no demand for change based on provided data.

Next distance to mouth: Since there's no stated preference or indication from previous bites that the distance to mouth should be adjusted, we will maintain the default value. This decision is guided by the principle of consistency, ensuring a reliable experience that the user seems to be comfortable with, as evidenced by no requests for change.

Next distance to mouth as float: 7.5

Next exit angle: Similarly, there is no feedback suggesting dissatisfaction with the exit angle used during previous interactions. The default value will be retained, relying on the assumption that the user finds the current setup suitable for their needs, or at least, not problematic enough to necessitate modification.

Next exit angle as float: 90.0
