Food Items Left: There are chicken, rice, and peas remaining on the plate with portions of 2, 1, and 2 respectively.
Previous bites fed: The latest food item that was fed is rice.
Strategy: Following the preference for feeding order and the past bites, my strategy involves continuing the pattern of feeding, considering the preference for one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice, and adjusting for the fact the rice portions are now fully consumed.
Next bite: Since the preference expresses one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice and the rice is now all eaten, the next logical step is to feed chicken according to the remaining preferences and portions.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of chicken, 1 portion of rice, and 2 portions of peas remaining on the plate.
Previous bites fed: The latest food item that was fed is chicken.
Strategy: Since the preference indicates wanting one bite of chicken followed by two bites of rice before anything else, and considering the latest bite was chicken, the next logical choice according to the preference would be rice. However, as we've already fed two bites of rice before, and given that all portions of chicken and rice intended based on your current preference have been consumed according to the portions available, the next choice should focus on what's remaining and available. Thus, switching to peas makes sense as the next item to maintain variety and adherence to the remaining portions.
Next bite: Feeding peas next.
