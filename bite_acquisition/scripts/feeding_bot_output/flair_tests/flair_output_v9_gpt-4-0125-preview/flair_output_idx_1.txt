Food Items Left: There are chicken, rice, and peas remaining on the plate with corresponding portions of 1, 1, and 2 respectively.
Previous bites fed: The latest food item that was fed is rice.
Strategy: Since the preference is for alternate bites of chicken and rice and both have been equally consumed based on previous bites, and considering the sequence, the next logical choice would be chicken to maintain the alternating sequence. Given there are no more chicken or rice left after this, peas would be the only option remaining for future bites.
