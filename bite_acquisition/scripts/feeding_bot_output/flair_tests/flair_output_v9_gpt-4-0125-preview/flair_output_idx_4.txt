Food Items Left: There are no portions of rice left, one portion of spinach remaining, and one portion of broccoli remaining.
Previous bites fed: The latest food item that was fed was rice.
Strategy: Since the preference specifies alternating between rice and vegetables, and all rice portions are consumed, the next choice should be a vegetable. Given rice was the last item eaten, and preferences for alternating cannot be met exactly due to rice being finished, we will continue with the vegetables left, following the order of consumption for variety.
