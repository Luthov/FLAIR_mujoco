Food Items Left: There are no chicken portions left, 1 portion of rice left, and 2 portions of peas left on the plate.
Previous bites fed: The latest food item that was fed was rice.
Strategy: Since the preference includes feeding larger bites of chicken followed by smaller bites of rice, and there's no chicken left, I will proceed to feed peas as it's the next available item, despite the preference not specifically mentioning peas. Since the preference was to feed chicken before rice and does not explicitly mention peas, I consider peas as the next sensible option available.
Next bite: I plan to feed peas next.

Next bite: A bite of rice as it alternates from the last peas bite and matches the previous servings strategy.
