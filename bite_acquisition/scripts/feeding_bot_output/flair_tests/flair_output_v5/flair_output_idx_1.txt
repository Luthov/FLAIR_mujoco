Food Items Left: There are chicken, rice, and peas left on the plate, with 2 portions each remaining.
Strategy: Since the preference is to alternate between chicken and rice, I will start by feeding chicken or rice first, considering there has been no prior bite to direct the initial choice. The strategy involves alternating between these two, ignoring peas due to the specified preference. The choice of starting with chicken or rice is arbitrary as no prior bites have been made to establish a sequence.
