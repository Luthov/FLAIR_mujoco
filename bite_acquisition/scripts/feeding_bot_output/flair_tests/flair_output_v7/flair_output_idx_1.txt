Food Items Left: There are 2 portions each of chicken, rice, and peas remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Since the preference is for alternating bites of chicken and rice, I plan to start with chicken as there is no previous bite to indicate what was last eaten and the preference allows starting with either. Larger bites are preferred and should be served further from the mouth.
Next bite: Starting with chicken for the alternating preference.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 2 portions each of chicken, rice, and peas remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Since the preference is for alternate bites of chicken and rice and the last bite was chicken, the next bite will be rice. The strategy aims to respect the preference for large bites and the spoon being further away.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 2 portions each of chicken, rice, and peas remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Since the preference is for alternate bites of chicken and rice with a liking for larger bite sizes and the spoon to be further from the mouth, and considering the last bite was rice, the next bite will be chicken. Preferences for bite size, distance to the mouth, and exit angle are taken from previous bites and explicit preferences.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of chicken remaining, 2 portions of rice remaining, and 2 portions of peas remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Since the preference is for alternate bites of chicken and rice, and considering the history of bites has followed this pattern starting with chicken, the next item should logically be rice to continue the alternating pattern, prioritizing larger bites and ensuring the spoon is further away from the mouth.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of chicken, 1 portion of rice, and 2 portions of peas remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Given your preference for alternate bites of chicken and rice, following the sequence of previously eaten bites and considering your preference for larger bites and the spoon to be further from you, my strategy involves continuing the sequence with a bite of chicken next since the last bite was rice.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of chicken, 1 portion of rice, and 2 portions of peas remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Since the preference is to alternate bites of chicken and rice, and considering the past bites have alternated between these two, the next logical step following this pattern and preference would be to serve chicken considering the last bite was rice. Peas are not part of the alternating pattern preference.
Next bite: Chicken
Next bite as list: ['chicken']
Next bite size: I will choose larger bites as per the preference.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no more portions of chicken left, 1 portion of rice left, and 2 portions of peas remaining.
Strategy: Since the preference is to alternate between chicken and rice but there's no chicken left, and considering the need to prioritize preferences, the next logical choice based on availability and past pattern is rice. After rice is consumed, peas remain but won't be chosen next due to the preference for chicken and rice alternating bites.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no portions of chicken left, 1 portion of rice, and 2 portions of peas remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Given the specified preference for alternating bites of chicken and rice and the history of large bites taken, the next logical step is to select rice as we cannot follow the exact preference due to the absence of chicken. The decision on bite size, distance to mouth, and exit angle will be derived from past preferences and instructions.
Next bite: Rice
Next bite as list: ['rice']
Next bite size: Larger bites have been preferred in the past, so I will choose a larger bite size.
Next bite size as float: 10.0
Next distance to mouth: The preference was for the spoon to be further away; thus, I will choose a distance further from prior cues.

Food Items Left: There are no portions of chicken or rice left, but there are 2 portions of peas remaining.
Strategy: Since there are no portions of chicken or rice remaining and the preference was for alternating bites of chicken and rice, but peas are the only food item left, the strategy is to feed peas while considering the preference for larger bites and the spoon to be further away.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are only peas left on the plate, with two portions remaining.
Strategy: Since the preference is for alternating bites of chicken and rice and those items have been finished, the only available option left is peas. Considering the preference for larger bites and spoon being further away, these parameters will be maintained.
