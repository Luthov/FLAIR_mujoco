=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no portions of spinach left, 2 portions of rice, and 2 portions of beef remaining on the plate.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no portions of spinach left, 1 portion of rice left, and 2 portions of beef left on the plate. 
Strategy: Since vegetables are to be eaten first and none are left, I will continue with the alternating pattern of rice and meat, giving rice as it was alternated with beef last.

Food Items Left: There are no portions of spinach left, 1 portion of rice, and 2 portions of beef left on the plate.
