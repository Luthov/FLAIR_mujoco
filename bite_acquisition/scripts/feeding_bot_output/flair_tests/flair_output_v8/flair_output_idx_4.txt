Food Items Left: There are three types of food items left on the plate: rice, spinach, and broccoli, each with two portions remaining.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 2 portions each of rice, spinach, and broccoli left on the plate.
Strategy: Alternating between a grain (rice) and vegetables (spinach and broccoli), keeping in mind the preference to alternate and to keep the spoon far from the mouth, as per instructions.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are portions of rice, spinach, and two portions of broccoli remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Given the preference for alternating between rice and vegetables and avoiding chicken, along with the history of past bites, the next bite will continue this pattern.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are portions of rice, spinach, and broccoli remaining on the plate, each with one portion left.
Strategy: Since the preference involves alternating between rice and vegetables, and considering the last bites alternated between rice and vegetables as well, the next logical step in the sequence, following the most recent consumption of broccoli, would be rice. Keeping the spoon far from the mouth has been consistent in prior feedings, so this will be maintained.
Next bite: The next bite planned is rice.
Next bite as list: ['rice']
