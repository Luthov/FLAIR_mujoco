Food Items Left: There are chicken, rice, and peas remaining on the plate, each with 2 portions left.

Strategy: Since the preference is for alternating bites of chicken and rice, and a preference for larger bites that are further away, I will alternate between feeding chicken and rice while ignoring peas. 

Next bite: Chicken will be the next bite since there's no history of previous bites to indicate the starting point, and it aligns with the preference to alternate between chicken and rice.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are chicken, rice, and peas left on the plate, with portions corresponding to 1, 1, and 2 respectively.
Strategy: Since the preference is to alternate bites between chicken and rice, and given the past bites, the next logical step is to alternate back to chicken, adhering to the preference of larger bites and maintaining the spoon further away.

=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are no chicken portions left, 1 portion of rice, and 2 portions of peas remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Since there's a preference for alternating bites of chicken and rice but there's no chicken left, the only option that matches the part of the preference about being fed is rice. Considering your preference for larger bites and maintaining the distance further away, the next food item to feed will be rice, following the pattern established.
