=== RESPONSE ===
Food Items Left: There are 1 portion of rice, 1 portion of chicken, and 2 portions of peas remaining.
Strategy: Since preferences indicate to avoid vegetables and give only rice and chicken, alternating between the two while keeping the bites small and tilting the spoon slightly, I will follow this pattern and prioritize the remaining rice and chicken accordingly.
Next bite: Rice will be the next bite since we have been alternating between rice and chicken, and preference is to avoid vegetables.
