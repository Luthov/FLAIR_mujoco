RESPONSE:
Food Items Left: There are 5 portions each of carrot, chicken, and rice left on the plate.
Strategy: I will alternate between feeding rice and grilled chicken according to the preference to alternate between the two, saving the carrots for last. Since efficiency for all items is 1, there's no priority based on efficiency. The previous bite information is not provided hence will follow the stated preference.
Next bite: Feed chicken

Next bite as list: ['chicken']
Next bite size: Since larger bites of meat are preferred and smaller bites of vegetables, a larger bite of chicken will be chosen.

RESPONSE:
Food Items Left: There are 5 portions each of carrot, chicken, and rice left on the plate.
Strategy: Given the preference to alternate between bites of rice and grilled chicken while saving carrots for last, and considering a previous bite of chicken was fed, the next bite will be rice. This alternation caters to the preference effectively before moving on to carrots.
Next bite: Feed rice
Next bite (accounting for efficiency): Feed rice

RESPONSE:
Food Items Left: There are 5 portions each of carrot, chicken, and rice remaining on the plate.
Strategy: Given your strong preference for alternating bites of rice and grilled chicken and saving the carrots for last, the strategy will be to alternate between rice and chicken, with a preference for larger bites of meat and smaller bites of vegetables. The previous bite fed was chicken.

RESPONSE:
Food Items Left: There are carrots, chicken, and rice remaining on the plate, with 5 portions of each available.
Strategy: Given your preference to alternate between bites of rice and grilled chicken and save the carrots for last, while also preferring larger bites of meat and smaller bites of vegetables, I plan to follow this pattern closely. The last bite you had was rice, following your past pattern, the next should logically be chicken.
Next bite: Feed chicken

RESPONSE:
Food Items Left: There are 5 portions of carrot, 4 portions of chicken, and 5 portions of rice left on the plate.
Strategy: Since the preference is to alternate between bites of rice and grilled chicken, with a preference for saving carrots for last, the sequence will follow this order. The last bite fed was chicken, so the next bite should be rice to maintain the alternation.
Next bite: Feed rice
Next bite (accounting for efficiency): Feed rice
Next bite as list: ['rice']
Next bite size: Since the bite preference includes larger bites of meat and smaller bites for vegetables and rice is neither strongly preferred for large nor small bites, the default bite size will be used.
Next bite size as float: 0.0
Next distance to mouth: Keeping the spoon closer for rice based on preferences, slightly closer than the default.
Next distance to mouth as float: 7.0
Next exit angle: Tilt the spoon a little higher when feeding rice to comply with the exit angle preference.

RESPONSE:
Food Items Left: There are 5 portions of carrots, 4 portions of chicken, and 4 portions of rice left on the plate.
Strategy: Since the preference is to alternate between bites of rice and grilled chicken, saving the carrots for last, and to have larger bites of meat and smaller bites of vegetables, the sequence will follow this pattern, starting with the next bite of rice since the past sequence showed an alternation and the last bite was chicken.
Next bite: Feed rice
