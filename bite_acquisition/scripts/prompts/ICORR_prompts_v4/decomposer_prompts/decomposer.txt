You are analyzing a user preference statement in a robot-assisted feeding pipeline. The user may describe preferences for:

Bite Acquisition: The order of foods, bite sizes, the speed at which to acquire food (e.g., "scoop the oatmeal slowly"), or specific patterns of eating (e.g., "alternate bites of rice and chicken", "I only want rice and vegetables").
Bite Transfer: How the spoon approaches or leaves the user's mouth (e.g., "tilt the spoon higher for rice") as well as the speed of the process (e.g., "move the spoon a little slower when feeding me")
User preference: {%s}

Decide if the preference relates to bite sequence, bite transfer, or both. Then, extract and summarize the detected preferences into two sentences. Output "None" if no preference is provided

Format your response:
Bite acquisition preference: <Extracted preference>
Bite transfer preference: <Extracted preference>
