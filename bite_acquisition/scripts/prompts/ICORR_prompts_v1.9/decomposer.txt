You are analyzing a user preference statement in a robot-assisted feeding pipeline. The user may describe preferences for:

Bite Acquisition: The order of foods, bite sizes, or specific patterns of eating (e.g., "alternate bites of rice and chicken", "I only want rice and vegetables").
Bite Transfer: How the spoon approaches or leaves the user's mouth (e.g., "tilt the spoon higher for rice").
User preference: {%s}

Decide if the preference relates to bite sequence, bite transfer, or both. Then, extract and summarize the detected preferences into two sentences. Output "None" if no preference is provided

Format your response:
Bite acquisition preference: <Extracted preference>
Bite transfer preference: <Extracted preference>
