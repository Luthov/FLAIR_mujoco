You are adjusting parameters for the bite acquisition primitive in a robot-assisted feeding pipeline. There are two adjustable parameters:
1. bite_size: Choose a value between 1.0 (smallest bite) and 10.0 (largest bite), default is 5.0.
2. next_food_item: Determine the next food item to feed based on the user's preference and sequence.

Input Details:
Preference: {%s}
Items remaining:{%s}
Portions remaining (corresponding to items remaining list): {%s}
Efficiency: {%s}
Bite History: {%s}. A list of previous bites and their parameters in the format [<food_item>, <bite_size>], with the last element being the most recent.

Instructions:
1. Summarize the user’s preference.
2. Decide Parameters:
- For bite_size, use cues like "smaller" or "larger" and prior values from the bite history. Default to 5.0 if no specific preference is stated.
- For next_food_item, determine what the next bite to feed.

Format Your Response:
Summary: <Brief explanation of the user’s preference>
Strategy: <Reasoning for the chosen values>
Next bite size: <Reason for bite_size choice>
Next bite size as float: <Chosen value as a float>
Next food item: <Reason for bite_position choice>
Next food item as string: <Chosen position as a string>
Ensure the response ends with "Next food item as string:" followed by the chosen value. Always suggest a value. Do NOT add any more line breaks in your response than what is specified above
