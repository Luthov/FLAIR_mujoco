You are feeding me a spoonfull of food.
Preference: %s
Next bite: %s
---
Given this information, you will decide what paramaters to change in the bite transfer process. There are 2 paramaters which you can modify 1) distance of the spoon to the patient's mouth (distance_to_mouth) and 2) the angle of tile of the spoon as it is exiting the patient's mouth (exit_angle). For the distance_to_mouth parameter you may ONLY suggest a number from 5.0 to 10.0, taking 7.5 as the DEFAULT value, for example, if the value for distance to mouth is lesser than 7.5 it means the spoon is closer to the mouth. For the exit_angle parameter you may ONLY suggest a number from 80.0 to 120.0 with 90.0 as the DEFAULT, the larger the value the higher the tilt, for example, if exit angle is less than 90.0 it means that the spoon is tilted lower than the default value. These 2 parameters are completely SEPARATE paramaters.
1) First, summarize and decompose what the preference is asking for.
    Decision Criteria:
        - In the past, I have eaten the following bites with their respective transfer parameters: %s. The items in the list are also lists where the first element is the bite that was fed to me, the second element is distance_to_mouth and the last element is exit_angle, they are arranged like so, [<bite>, <distance_to_mouth>, <exit_angle>]. The first item of this list is the first bite I had, the second item is the second bite, and so on. The last element is the most recent bite that I just had. The 'Next bite' is the bite that is going to be fed to the patient right now. Use this and the bite history to inform your decisions in changing the distance_to_mouth and exit_angle paramaters
3) Next, determine the distance_to_mouth parameter, based on the preference and the previous distance_to_mouth values you suggested. If there is no preference then choose the default value. Look for words such as further or closer to decide what value to give. Do NOT vary this parameter to accomodate for other paramaters, ONLY vary this parameter if the preference indicates to do so. If the default value is chosen state that you're choosing the default value when giving the reason for choosing the distance_to_mouth value. Base the values you choose off of the DEFAULT value which is 7.5.
4) Next, determine the exit_angle parameter, based on the exit angle preference and the previous exit_angle values you suggested. Make sure the exit angle preference is asking for the exit_angle parameter to change. If there is no preference found for the exit_angle then choose the default value. Pay special attention to words like exit, approach, higher and lower to decide what value to choose. Do NOT vary this parameter to accomodate for other paramaters, ONLY vary this parameter if the exit angle preference indicates to do so. Base the values you choose off of the DEFAULT value which is 90.0.

Format your response as follows, be concise but thorough:
Summary: <Phrase describing what the preference exactly wants>
Next distance to mouth: <Phrase describing the distance_to_mouth value you plan to choose>
Next distance to mouth as float: <Distance to mouth chosen as a floating point number. Do NOT add any comments here>
Next exit angle: <Phrase describing the exit angle value you plan to choose>
Next exit angle as float: <Exit angle chosen as a floating point number>
---
Output your response here. Ensure that the last line ends with 'Next exit angle as float: '. You MUST ALWAYS suggest a value.
