Given this information, you will decide what bite to feed me next, how much to feed, and three bite transfer parameters, distance_to_mouth, exit_angle and exit_angle. You may ONLY suggest a bite from the available 'Items remaining', optionally dipped in an item from 'Dipping sauces.'. You may ONLY suggest a number from -1.0 to 1.0 with 0.0 as the DEFAULT value for 'Bite size', the larger the number the larger the bite will be. Distance to mouth is a parameter which determines how far the spoon should be before performing the bite transfer process. You may ONLY suggest a number from 5.0 to 10.0 with 7.5 as the DEFAULT value for 'distance_to_mouth'. Exit angle is a parameter which determines the angle at which the spoon exits the user's mouth. You may ONLY suggest a number from 80.0 to 120.0 with 90.0 as the DEFAULT value for 'exit_angle'. Bite size, distance to mouth and exit angle are ALL SEPARATE parameters and do not AFFECT each other.
1) First, summarize what food items are remaining on the plate with corresponding portions. Make sure that your summarization matches with the 'Items remaining', 'Portions remaining' provided at the beginning.
2) Next, summarize your high-level strategy for feeding me. Describe the order of bites you would use to feed me the remaining items, and explain how you make your decision. Note that bites taken so far do not affect items remaining.
   Decision Criteria:
    - Prioritize my preference above all else. If I have a strong preference for a particular ordering of foods, you should obey that as best as possible. Respect user preferences for not dipping certain food items in certain sauces. If the preference specifies 'Feed me X and then Y', perceive it as me asking you to feed all of X before you feed any of Y.
    - "Alternating between X and Y" means you can start with either X or Y, unless otherwise specified. If one item is more efficient, start with that.
    - In the past, I have eaten the following bites with their respective bite sizes: %s. The items in the list are tuples where the first element is the bite, the second element is bite size and the last two are the bite transfer parameters eg. (<bite>, <bite_size>, <distance_to_mouth>, <exit_angle>). The first item of this list is a tuple and the first element of that tuple is the first bite I had and the other elements in the tuple are the respective parameters chosen for that bite, the second item is also a tuple and the first element of that tuple is the second bite I had and the other elements in the tuple are the respective parameters chosen for that bite, and so on. The last element is a tuple and the first element of that tuple contains the most recent bite that I just and the other elements in the tuple are the respective parameters chosen for that bite. Use this to inform what you feed me next and how much. Note that bites taken so far are past bites and thus do not affect the specified items or portions remaining on the plate.
    - In your answer, state the portions of each item remaining. Ensure that this matches with the 'Portions remaining' provided at the beginning. Note that these items haven't been consumed. If I do not have a strong preference, use commonsense. For dishes like noodles with vegetables and meat, or porridge with different toppings, prioritize feeding me a MIX of different items. This means do not feed me the same item consecutively twice if it doesn't affect efficiency. The exception to this rule is if there is a lot more of one item than another. In that case, you should prioritize feeding me the item with more quantity, until the portions of items left are more evenly distributed, even if I have eaten the larger portion item consecutively. If only a single portion of an item is left, do not feed it but leave it until later for better bite variety (unless the preference instructs otherwise). Lastly, use your best judgment to figure out what ordering makes sense. For instance, looking at a plate of carrots, ranch, canteloupe, apples, and caramel, you should be able to tell that apples go with the caramel, and carrots go with the ranch, and that apple should not be dipped in ranch because that is not typical, and canteloupe and other melon types should be eaten plain. Avoid feeding savory foods with sweet sauces, and vice versa (i.e. chicken nugget and chocolate sauce is NOT a good suggestion, apple should not be dipped in ketchup; canteloupe, honeydew, and melons are usually eaten plain without sauce). A good rule of thumb is to prioritize: common pairings (i.e. sweet savory), portion sizes, and bite variability (in that order).
3) Next, choose an item from 'Items available' to feed next, based on your answer to 2). Examples: "Feed shrimp", "Feed apple dipped in caramel", "Do not feed a bite". You can either feed a single food item which appears in 'Items remaining' ("Feed shrimp"), a single food item dipped in something ("Feed apple dipped in caramel"), or opt to not feed an item ("Do not feed a bite"); only do this if I strongly dislike the remaining bites, or I only requested a 2 bites of 'tiramisu,' for example, at the end of a meal, and you already fed me both (as mentioned in 'The bites I have taken so far'). You CANNOT feed a dip (i.e. ranch, mustard, whipped cream, bbq sauce, chocolate sauce, etc.) by itself. You can ONLY feed an item if it is present in 'Items remaining.' For example, given 'Items remaining: ["broccoli", "asparagus"]', you cannot suggest "Feed pasta", even if I have taken a bite of 'pasta' in the past.
4) Next, determine a bite size to feed me, based ONLY on the bite preference and the previous bite sizes. Use commonsense when deciding how much to feed, especially notice words such as 'very' or phrases like 'a lot less'. If there is no preference for a specific food then choose the default size. Do NOT vary this parameter to accomodate for other paramaters, ONLY vary this parameter if the bite preference indicates to do so.
5) Next, determine the distance_to_mouth parameter, based on the distance to mouth preference and the previous distance_to_mouth values you suggested. If there is no preference then choose the default value. Look for words such as further or closer to decide what value to give. Do NOT vary this parameter to accomodate for other paramaters, ONLY vary this parameter if the distance to mouth preference indicates to do so. If the default value is chosen state that you're choosing the default value when giving the reason for choosing the distance_to_mouth value. Base the values you choose off of the DEFAULT value which is 7.5.
6) Next, determine the exit_angle parameter, based on the exit angle preference and the previous exit_angle values you suggested. Make sure the exit angle preference is asking for the exit_angle parameter to change. If there is no preference found for the exit_angle then choose the default value. Pay special attention to words like exit, approach, higher and lower to decide what value to choose. Do NOT vary this parameter to accomodate for other paramaters, ONLY vary this parameter if the exit angle preference indicates to do so. Base the values you choose off of the DEFAULT value which is 90.0.
7) Now, consider efficiency; in the numbers listed above, higher means that food item is more efficient to pick up. Would you change your answer to 3) given this information? If the portions are even (difference of <3 bites), and my preference is weak or alternating, and one item is clearly more efficient, you may change your answer. Otherwise, do not change your answer.
8) Now, summarize your planned bite from 4) in a list format. You can either output a single item in a list ['item'], where 'item' is chosen from 'Items remaining', if you would like to feed this item by itself. Or, you can output two items in a list ['item1', 'item2'], if you would like to dip 'item1' (from 'Items remaining') in 'item2' (from 'Dipping sauces remaining') i.e. ['banana', 'nutella']. However, you cannot suggest to feed 2 items if one of them is not a dip (i.e. ['ramen', 'beef'] or ['rice', 'chicken'] or ['linguini', 'mushroom'] are NOT allowed, you must feed ['ramen'] or ['beef'] by itself). Lastly, you can output an empty list [] if there is absolutely no bite that makes sense.
