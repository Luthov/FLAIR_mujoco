You are feeding me a plate of food.
Items remaining: %s
Portions remaining (corresponding to items remaining list): %s 
Preference: %s
---
Given this information, you will decide what bite to feed me next, how much to feed, and two bite transfer parameters, distance_to_mouth, exit_angle. You may ONLY suggest a bite from the available 'Items remaining'. You may ONLY suggest a number from 1.0 to 10.0 with 5.0 as the DEFAULT value for 'Bite size', the larger the number the larger the bite will be. Distance to mouth is a parameter which determines how far the spoon should be before performing the bite transfer process. You may ONLY suggest a number from 5.0 to 10.0 with 7.5 as the DEFAULT value for 'distance_to_mouth'. Exit angle is a parameter which determines the angle at which the spoon exits the user's mouth. You may ONLY suggest a number from 80.0 to 120.0 with 90.0 as the DEFAULT value for 'exit_angle', the larger the value the higher the tilt, for example, if exit angle is less than 90.0 it means that the spoon is tilted lower than the default value. Bite size, distance to mouth and exit angle are ALL SEPARATE parameters and do not AFFECT each other.
1) First, summarize what food items are remaining on the plate with corresponding portions. Make sure that your summarization matches with the 'Items remaining', 'Portions remaining' provided at the beginning.
2) Next, choose an item from 'Items available' to feed next, based on your answer to 2). Examples: "Feed shrimp", "Do not feed a bite". You can either feed a single food item which appears in 'Items remaining' ("Feed shrimp") or opt to not feed an item ("Do not feed a bite"); only do this if I strongly dislike the remaining bites, or I only requested a 2 bites of 'tiramisu,' for example, at the end of a meal, and you already fed me both (as mentioned in 'The bites I have taken so far'). You can ONLY feed an item if it is present in 'Items remaining.' For example, given 'Items remaining: ["broccoli", "asparagus"]', you cannot suggest "Feed pasta", even if I have taken a bite of 'pasta' in the past.
   Decision Criteria:
    - Prioritize my preference above all else. If I have a strong preference for a particular ordering of foods, you should obey that as best as possible. If the preference specifies 'Feed me X and then Y', perceive it as me asking you to feed all of X before you feed any of Y.
    - "Alternating between X and Y" means you can start with either X or Y, unless otherwise specified.
    - In the past, I have eaten the following bites with their respective bite sizes: %s. The items in the list are lists where the first element is the bite, the second element is bite size and the last two are the bite transfer parameters eg. [<bite>, <bite_size>, <distance_to_mouth>, <exit_angle>]. The first item of this list is the first bite I had, the second item is the second bite, and so on. The last element is the most recent bite that I just had. Use this to inform what you feed me next and how much. Note that bites taken so far are past bites and thus do not affect the specified items or portions remaining on the plate.
    - In your answer, state the portions of each item remaining. Ensure that this matches with the 'Portions remaining' provided at the beginning. Note that these items haven't been consumed. If I do not have a strong preference, use commonsense. For dishes like noodles with vegetables and meat, or porridge with different toppings, prioritize feeding me a MIX of different items. This means do not feed me the same item consecutively twice. The exception to this rule is if there is a lot more of one item than another. In that case, you should prioritize feeding me the item with more quantity, until the portions of items left are more evenly distributed, even if I have eaten the larger portion item consecutively. If only a single portion of an item is left, do not feed it but leave it until later for better bite variety (unless the preference instructs otherwise). Lastly, use your best judgment to figure out what ordering makes sense. A good rule of thumb is to prioritize: common pairings (i.e. sweet savory), portion sizes, and bite variability (in that order).
3) Next, determine a bite size to feed me, based on the preference and the previous bite sizes. Use commonsense when deciding how much to feed, especially notice words such as 'very' or phrases like 'a lot less'. If there is no preference for a specific food then choose the default size. Do NOT vary this parameter to accomodate for other paramaters, ONLY vary this parameter if the preference indicates to do so.
4) Next, determine the distance_to_mouth parameter, based on the preference and the previous distance_to_mouth values you suggested. Make sure the preference is asking for the distance_to_mouth parameter to change. If there is no preference for the distance_to_mouth then choose the default value. Look for words such as further or closer to decide whether the preference is asking to modify distance_to_mouth and decide what value to give. Do NOT vary this parameter to accomodate for other paramaters, ONLY vary this parameter if the preference indicates to do so. If the default value is chosen state that you're choosing the default value when giving the reason for choosing the distance_to_mouth value.
5) Next, determine the exit_angle parameter, based on the preference and the previous exit_angle values you suggested. Make sure the preference is asking for the exit_angle parameter to change. If there is no preference found for the exit_angle then choose the default value. Pay special attention to words like exit, approach, higher and lower to decide whether the preference is asking to modify exit_angle and decide what value to give. Do NOT vary this parameter to accomodate for other paramaters, ONLY vary this parameter if the preference indicates to do so.
6) Now, summarize your planned bite from 4) in a list format. You can either output a single item in a list ['item'], where 'item' is chosen from 'Items remaining'. Lastly, you can output an empty list [] if there is absolutely no bite that makes sense.

Format your response as follows, be concise but thorough. Do NOT change the wording of anything in the output unless it is something you need to change:
Food Items Left: <Sentence describing what food items are left on the plate; ensure that this matches with the 'Items remaining' provided at the beginning>
Next bite: <Phrase describing the next bite you plan to feed>
Next bite as list: ['item1'] # Or []
Next bite size: <Phrase describing the bite size you plan to choose>
Next bite size as float: <bite size chosen as floating point number. Do NOT write comments here>
Next distance to mouth: <Phrase describing the distance to mouth value you plan to choose>
Next distance to mouth as float: <distance to mouth chosen as floating point number. Do NOT write comments here>
Next exit angle: <Phrase describing the exit_angle value you plan to choose>
Next exit angle as float: <exit angle chosen as floating point number. Do NOT write comments here>
---
Output your response here. Ensure that the last line begins with 'Next exit angle as float:'.
